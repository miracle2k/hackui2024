Courtesy of the artist and Bright Moments\nJason Bailey: As an artist who grew up as the black sheep in a family of engineers, I\u2019d love to know how your passion for mathematics and computer science came together with art. \n\n\u200dSputniko!: I was born in Tokyo in 1985. My mother is British and my father is Japanese. My parents were both mathematics researchers and professors, so math was talked about a lot in my household. With both specializing in time series analysis, my parents had a lot of computers in the house, which I played with from a very young age. I started programming in elementary school when I was around 11 years old. I figured out how to connect my computer to the Internet, so I was considered a computer geek and I got bullied so much for it, also because I\u2019m half-British, which is unusual in Japan. My classmates used to call me: \u201cGaijin!\u201d \u2014 the derogatory term for foreigners. That experience trained me to not be particularly interested in mainstream labels. I\u2019ve become so used to being the odd one out that I don\u2019t hesitate to cross borders and question labels. \n\nWhen I was growing up, I loved using computers to draw things and to make music and animations. So I had this love for creating. But when you\u2019re young, and your parents are both math professors, they assume you\u2019ll study mathematics as well. In 2003, I moved to London to study mathematics and computer science at Imperial College. I used to code ActionScript for a living, making interactive websites for BBC, MTV, Nike, and Shonen Jump manga in Japan. A lot of people thought I was going to continue as an engineer. But, growing up as a teenager in Japan, my inspirations were female artists and performers like Laurie Anderson, Sofia Coppola, and Miranda July who adopted feminist, gender-based messaging as a means of empowerment. That really struck me growing up in Japan, where the level of gender inequality is quite bad.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2869, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb66a63a-97f6-4eae-bfce-12a5ca749545": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb66a63a-97f6-4eae-bfce-12a5ca749545", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d08548f8-d1e7-41cf-80a3-329d10652e5c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "75c8a9ed63e2e8667dd7be37ebd0ace746c13b0fe0268f5000467790d2a2b1bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b6c0fe75-fa9e-40dd-80f5-7c89d63e18e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "92e10e6e30e0abc9bbd6b54a05fcaf71206601b2e8a20e5ea987e89984d6f38b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "862fcb49-5855-4a9a-88f2-2b60c409a119", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "41235d0fc40be6f73bdbefe5585381dc25dd9a48333745c36e24c85c7ce524e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Sputniko!, Menstruation Machine \u2013 Takashi\u2019s Take, 2010. Courtesy of the artist\nI had another realization at university, where I was only one of very few female students studying computer science. While I was very excited to be learning about early machine learning, neural networks, and bioinformatics, I started to feel that these technologies didn\u2019t really solve some of the issues faced by women and minorities. This was particularly true of the issue of women\u2019s health, including menstruation, menopause, and pregnancy. \n\nWhen I was growing up in Japan, I had very bad PMS (premenstrual syndrome), which affected me every month and also impacted my studies. I thought: \u201cWell, technology and science have solved so many problems in the world, why am I still struggling with something so primitive in 2003!?\u201d \u200d\nMy research into menstruation led me to discover just how much is yet to be resolved due to the gender gap in technology. There was a lot of medication that helped women feel better during menstruation that I didn\u2019t know about because it was not discussed by the Japanese media. I also found out that Japan took 40 years to approve oral contraceptives. When it did, in 1999, it was the last member country of the United Nations to do so. Many politicians suggested that the contraceptive pill could make women overly sexually active, which is ironic considering Japan approved Viagra in only six months. It was quite a hilarious double standard. I found out about all these things when I was about 18 or 19 and, inspired by the artists I\u2019ve just mentioned, I started making music and music videos as a hobby \u2014 writing songs about technology and singing about women and feminism. \n\nAfter graduating in 2006, I worked as an engineer for two years. But having harbored a passion for music and arts, I joined a fantastic course at the Royal College of Art called Design Interactions, taught by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby. Of all my classmates, I was the only one with a background in engineering or mathematics.\n\n\nSputniko!, Tranceflora \u2013 Amy\u2019s Glowing Silk, 2015. Commission by Gucci. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dJB: Most of the folks I know who work at the intersection of art and tech are primarily art-driven. But, from what you\u2019ve shared, it\u2019s really more that you were in engineering and saw the need to communicate the injustices, biases, and uneven impact of technology across genders, which naturally brought you to music and art. You\u2019re often discussing topics that people are uncomfortable with, like menstruation and inequality, and you\u2019re using formats even some artists are uncomfortable with. I\u2019m curious about why you choose to use the music video format to deliver these messages. Is it to expand the number of people who can participate in the debate, or is that just what you\u2019re most comfortable with? \n\n\u200dS: I don\u2019t really have a conventional fine arts background. As an engineer who sings and makes music videos, I was a bit of a black sheep at the Royal College of Art. Quite naturally, I started sharing stories about menstruation. When I exhibited Menstruation Machine in 2010, it coincided with the rise of YouTube and Twitter culture. I remember at the time, not too many artists put their films on YouTube because it wasn\u2019t considered a very sophisticated platform. But I thought: \u201cIf I want to make work that stimulates a discussion, then why not put it on a platform that allows me to have as many discussions as possible.\u201d Different museum curators saw my work on YouTube, and invited me to display my art in the museum, including Yuko Hasegawa, who used to be the Artistic Director at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo, and Paola Antonelli from MoMA, New York.\n\n\u200d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2873, "end_char_idx": 6579, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "862fcb49-5855-4a9a-88f2-2b60c409a119": {"__data__": {"id_": "862fcb49-5855-4a9a-88f2-2b60c409a119", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d08548f8-d1e7-41cf-80a3-329d10652e5c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "75c8a9ed63e2e8667dd7be37ebd0ace746c13b0fe0268f5000467790d2a2b1bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb66a63a-97f6-4eae-bfce-12a5ca749545", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "089dc4840719c71b2e4867003ee1e545c6bb23ea9957227aa5bae488cc89244a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "18fcaa41-c81d-44b0-8ffc-64b95c6acb48", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef15506e2b2f69c35a8a7909bff9ac174ab84d6bee5b245eb6081d025b554e22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Sputniko!, Menstruation Machine \u2013 Takashi\u2019s Take, 2010. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dJB: The art world often sees anything tech-related as artificial, anti-humanity, and an intrusive evil. Do you see storytelling and mythologies as ways to reframe issues in a way that makes people more comfortable with technology? \n\n\u200dS: I think, historically, people have used mythologies and religions to make sense of the world. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting how people feel about technology because, when you think about it, farming is technology, and printing is technology. So what we think is technology today, might soon become a normal part of human life. \u200d\nIt\u2019s more about how we use technology. Social media was a utopia that allowed me to show my work. But then it became a platform for fake news and conspiracy theories. So I think it\u2019s fair that some people are worried about the negative implications of technology. In my work, I\u2019m most interested in the implications of technology, whether it will become dystopian, and what defines dystopia. I portray a certain vision of the future of technology. \n\n\nSputniko!, The Moonwalk Machine \u2013 Selena\u2019s Step, 2013. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dJB: One thing your work brings to mind is the power of viral storytelling versus actual building. When I look at a work like The Moonwalk Machine \u2013 Selena\u2019s Step (2013), at first, I think: \u201cIs there actually going to be a machine sent to the moon, and what are the logistics of that?\u201d But when I view the work, I realize just how insignificant it is that the machine never got built. If the machine were to be built, the focus would be more on the machine, and less on the narrative. Storytelling is sometimes the ideal format. \n\n\u200dS: It\u2019s true, The Moonwalk Machine hasn\u2019t gone to the moon. It\u2019s a fictional prototype. But we actually did engineer the Red Silk of Fate (2016/2021). Nonetheless, I think it doesn\u2019t always have to be built because, for me, the narrative, questions, and discussions I want to stimulate are more important than the technology itself. I do enough research to show that something could be built if you wanted to, in order to avoid making it seem too fantastical. A lot of the work that came out of my course at the Royal College was based on future narratives. \n\n\u200d\n\n\nSputniko!, Red Silk of Fate \u2013 Tamaki\u2019s Crush, 2016. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dThe Red Thread of Fate is a very famous mythology in Japan, China, and Korea that says that two people who are destined to meet each other romantically have an invisible red thread between them. For this work, I looked through different research papers on bioengineering and found a very interesting scientist in Japan, Professor Hideki Sezutsu, who genetically engineered silkworms to produce silk that glowed red and green using the genes of jellyfish and coral. So I thought: \u201cWhat if we engineer something that only existed in mythology?\u201d I asked Sezutsu-Sensei if he could add a type of gene that produces oxytocin, known as a love hormone, together with a gene from a red glowing coral so that the silk produced would look a little bit like the Red Thread of Fate. In just a few months, the professor managed to create the world\u2019s first silk that glows red containing oxytocin. \n\nThis collaboration between an artist and a scientist created a new living organism that existed exclusively in Asian mythology. \u200d\nI had quite mixed feelings when I saw it with my own eyes because it was quite a controversial notion. I wanted to consider the perspectives of different Asian religions on genetic engineering. So, after I created this Red Thread of Fate, I visited a Shinto shrine and had a conversation with the priest of Kanda Myojin, which is one of the oldest shrines in Tokyo. I asked them how they felt about bioengineering technology. The Shinto priest described the Shinto belief that a spirit lives in everything \u2014 in the wind, a stone, a mountain, or a tree. So if there is a new living organism, even if it is created artificially, there is going to be a new spirit. I then created an installation, which is shaped like a shrine. This was shown in Hong Kong last November, due to be shown again in Singapore in 2023.\n\n\nSputniko!, Red Silk of Fate \u2013 The Shrine, 2021.

What has been your experience so far?\n\n\u200dS: It\u2019s been almost a year since I started exploring the NFT space. I am very certain that it will change the ecosystem of art forever. Before NFTs emerged, I sold my work in contemporary art spaces, like art fairs, but I\u2019m not the contemporary art market type. \n\nI think Web2 gave artists freedom to share, but it didn\u2019t really give artists freedom to sell something of value. \nIf you wanted to sell your works they usually had to be displayed in physical spaces like galleries and these were often very exclusive and not so decentralized. Now it feels very natural to buy and sell artworks online, and it empowers both artists and collectors alike. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also true that, at the moment, a lot of the artists and collectors are male. I\u2019m excited about some initiatives like Unicorn DAO, which is commissioning female and LGBTQ artists. They invited me to curate and commissioned me to do a piece. I created wearables that allow avatars to bleed in the metaverse \u2014 a Menstruation Machine for the metaverse. I created pants that avatars can wear that are stained with menstrual blood. But when I put them through the application process, unfortunately, all of these wearables were rejected, because no blood patches were allowed in the metaverse at all. We had some interesting conversations on the review page. \n\nI asked them: \u201cWhy is this not allowed in Decentraland?\u201d I made a joke and asked: \u201cIf the blood was blue, would you allow it?\u201d And they said: \u201cYes.\u201d \n\nSputniko!, Menstrualverse, 2022. Courtesy of the artist\nMenstruation is something that half the population on the planet experiences, and to be censored and rejected like that in Decentraland \u2014 such a major platform \u2014 was quite surprising. So although people talk about trying to make Web3 or the metaverse more inclusive, ironically it just feels like traditional values and perspectives are being perpetuated. [...]\n\nI developed from an engineer to a musician, and then I started being called an artist, but I felt like a bit of an activist with an interest in women\u2019s health and reproductive issues. That led me to create a new women\u2019s health startup in Japan, called Cradle. Right now, I\u2019m actually dividing my time as an artist. Half the time, I\u2019m the CEO of Cradle, a startup that provides services to Japanese corporations, which are often very male-dominated.  My clients include Yahoo, Deloitte, NEC, Shiseido, and Sony. \n\nI felt that many women in Japan didn\u2019t have enough knowledge about contraceptive pills, menstruation, menopause, pregnancy, and fertility treatments largely due to these topics being taboo in Japanese society. Because of that, I created this new service that provides educational content and online seminars for people to learn about their bodies and treatments. We have a network of over 90 women\u2019s health clinics around Japan, which female employees can go to and receive discounts on different treatments, including breast and ovarian cancer check-ups, gynecological examination, egg freezing, and other fertility treatments. This is a new challenge for me because being an artist and being the CEO of a company are very different. \n\nI have a vision about creating a world with better access to women\u2019s healthcare. For me, this startup is my new artwork. It wouldn\u2019t be exhibited in a museum, but it is as important as my Menstruation Machine. Some recent tech startups are really changing how people live and work. And Jason, you\u2019re also trying to shape how people collect art and culture with ClubNFT. \n\nI love Joseph Beuys\u2019s notion of \u201csocial sculpture,\u201d and I feel that if artists are social sculptors in 2022, then maybe startup culture is a new medium for sculpting our future society. \n\nSputniko!, Tokyo Medical University For Rejected Women, 2019. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dJB: Throughout history, when people were using paintings or drawings or illuminated manuscripts, they weren\u2019t obsessed with the formats themselves. The formats were simply ways to communicate with larger groups of people.

How did that come about?\n\n\u200dSnowfro: I was introduced to the President and CEO of Pace, Marc Glimcher, in February or March of 2021. And something Marc demonstrated early on was a curiosity not only about NFTs but also the concept of generative minting. He was particularly interested in the idea \u2014 one that we\u2019ve always fought for at Art Blocks \u2014 that the artist can watch the birth of a collection at the same time as the collector. \n\nMarc introduced me and Jeff Davis (Chief Creative Officer at Art Blocks) to his wonderful team and we started having conversations about what it might look like for Pace to introduce artists to Art Blocks, and to the concept of generative, on-demand minting. Obviously, we\u2019ve established ourselves as a great place to do this type of work \u2014 we have the technology, we have a collector base that seems to truly understand art, and we\u2019re excited to share that group of people with the traditional art world. \n\n\nArt Blocks X Pace Verso, 2022. Courtesy of Art Blocks\n\u200dAE: It\u2019s often assumed that the people who collect crypto art and those who collect mainstream contemporary art are different people. How true is that from your experience?\u200d\n\nS: I think originally they were different people. I sure as hell didn\u2019t feel comfortable walking into an art gallery a year and a half ago. I didn\u2019t know much about contemporary art other than the artists I\u2019ve always followed like James Turrell, Robert Irwin, and Donald Judd (1928-1994). So we are different people. But we are also settling on a joint appreciation of something that\u2019s pretty new and special. \n\nBoth traditional art collectors and NFT degenerates \u2014 which I consider myself \u2014 are supportive of artists, both on the primary market and through secondary market royalties. This is something extra powerful in the generative space where there are so many more mints, and where people are constantly trading one piece for another, because they like red more than yellow, etc. There\u2019s just so much more movement and dynamism in a market like that.

Courtesy of the artist\nAE: Is the culture of resale royalties that has emerged in the NFT space starting to penetrate the traditional art world?\n\n\u200dS: Something that is really interesting here is that the Pace roster of artists is possibly being exposed to the potential of a secondary market royalty for the first time in their careers. And that has to feel pretty special. No matter what level you are in your career, whether you\u2019re making $50 per week or $50 per month in secondary market royalties, or you\u2019re an established artist who has always felt the need to create new work to survive \u2014 maybe this can allow you to take a step back and enjoy your project, to immerse yourself not only in what you created, but in the community response that you\u2019ve generated.\u200d\n\n\u200dAE: For me, Web3 is at its best when it embraces grassroots creator communities around the world. Do you worry that engaging with the traditional art world could override those qualities that are native to the NFT space?\u200d\n\nS: Yes, we worry about it a lot. Every time we make a big step at Art Blocks, we ask ourselves: \u201cWhat is this going to do for our current artists? What is this going to do for the medium of generative art?\u201d Our job is to host the best generative art by the best artists in the world, and we want to elevate generative art to the top leagues. And it feels like a misalignment of our priorities to not elevate generative art to a new level simply because we\u2019re concerned about the perception that we\u2019re no longer a grassroots platform. \n\nWe are still so early in this space, and we have such a tiny collector base compared to the world of art in general. As a platform, Art Blocks will learn from Pace, which has 60 years of experience navigating the art world. But I also believe that Pace will learn from Art Blocks. \u200d\n\nSnowfro, Chromie Squiggle #807, 2021. Courtesy of the artist\nAE: One striking quality of generative art is the surprise that each output generates. It feels like a generous art that unites artists and collectors within a mutually supportive community. You are an artist with your own practice, but you\u2019ve also done a lot to decentralize creativity through Art Blocks. Does generative art alter the identity of the artist?\u200d\n\nS: To me, it is really important that the coherence of the artist remains. Because that is how they will benefit the most from their dedication to this craft. But there are also new synergies that are emerging out of collectivity \u2014 people are curating sets of different artworks by different artists that might have a shared color theme or style. Nobody was expecting that. \n\nWith Art Blocks, there developed a trend for collecting one of every generative work within the curated collection, or one work from every series. And this concept of collectibility actually rubs the contemporary art world the wrong way, because they\u2019re trying to avoid being swept into owning collectibles rather than artworks. But from my perspective, this concept of collectibility within our space is special, and it\u2019s something the contemporary art world can get excited about.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2619, "end_char_idx": 5752, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de9d0c76-fa69-482f-9f6e-c74e8452aff5": {"__data__": {"id_": "de9d0c76-fa69-482f-9f6e-c74e8452aff5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9a65bc59-3a26-4adb-93e4-ff99921045b7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "20634d99db2c00c151fd8e43b3a46b3422aa62fd8291cfe6975603ebdb5a832f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7fb12d46-dba7-4f8e-afa4-e539647b06a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "01cabb0c699cc9b630f5c0ab510a961a971c2ed18d8ae26535e2bb496f69336e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ccb5fcda-2904-4164-8977-7a0ef9183d73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "54ecb695caf8ca2990df6766a0e5518a4601aebe3059ff847b89549429ecd9a7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Snowfro, Chromie Squiggle #805, 2020. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dAE: Where do you see the boundary between long-form generative art that can produce thousands of outputs and 10K PFP (profile picture) projects that rely on generative systems? Is the difference simply utility?\u200d\n\nS: Generative art enables one person to impart their artistic vision to more works than they might otherwise be able to produce by hand. If artists could make 10,000 things by hand within a reasonable time frame, maybe generative approaches wouldn\u2019t be so effective. Today, we live in a more globalized world where the number of potential collectors is significantly higher than ever before. However, many collectors cannot afford to buy art at very high prices, which dictates the future of how art is collected. It may also shape the production of art toward collectibility. \n\nI actually think that there\u2019s a lot of utility in what we\u2019re doing at Art Blocks. I don\u2019t think that Tyler Hobbs or Kjetil Golid are going to be interested in pursuing utility for their work. But as an open infrastructure ecosystem, in principle anyone could create a gating mechanism whereby collectors are only able to purchase a new work if they already own a Paper Armada (2021). Personally, I reject the term \u201ccollectible\u201d because, as a collector, I\u2019m driven to own one of every color set of my favorite generative art project. \n\nAm I treating the work as a collectible even if I\u2019m driven to participate in its artistic creation at a deep level? Why should collectibility make something any less art? There is going to be overlap between art and collectibles and it\u2019s going to make some people uncomfortable. But people should be free to experience art in the way they want. \u200d\nI\u2019m proud of my collection of CryptoPunks (2017), Autoglyphs (2019), and Meebits (2021) as well as NBA Top Shot and I don\u2019t care if people regard them as collectibles or not. I want to put them in a gallery so that people from the traditional art world can feel the same joy as I do.\u200d\n\n\nSnowfro, Chromie Squiggle #1809, 2020. Courtesy of the artist\nAE: Generative art projects like Autoglyphs (2019) sit within the lineage of early computer art as well as modernist painting. It seems to me that perhaps the greatest success of Art Blocks has been to elevate generative art to the level of importance it always deserved. How do you feel about that? \u200d\n\nS: When we\u2019re talking about our favorite art, maybe we don\u2019t need to use words like \u201cpainting,\u201d \u201csculpture,\u201d or even \u201cgenerative art.\u201d Maybe \u201cart\u201d is enough. When I think about what James Turrell is doing, it\u2019s not generative, but it is programming light. And if I had the financial wherewithal to do it, I would want to collect Projection Pieces by Turrell in every shape. Does that make them collectibles? I don\u2019t think so. \u200d\u200d\n\n\u200dAE: Does the NFT suit more ephemeral approaches to art?\u200d\n\nS: 100%. With generative NFTs you can create an instruction set for humans to enact a performance, or for computers to create projections, or for fountains to spray water based on algorithmic instructions. And because that choreography is based on the entropy of the hash, it can be replicated identically within the NFT \u2014 to be taken home and re-experienced as a moment captured in real life. We are driven by our memories and our experiences, and I\u2019d never want to reduce the value of art to that of a souvenir. But being able to preserve a memory is almost equivalent to buying a piece of art. \u200d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5755, "end_char_idx": 9230, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ccb5fcda-2904-4164-8977-7a0ef9183d73": {"__data__": {"id_": "ccb5fcda-2904-4164-8977-7a0ef9183d73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9a65bc59-3a26-4adb-93e4-ff99921045b7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "20634d99db2c00c151fd8e43b3a46b3422aa62fd8291cfe6975603ebdb5a832f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "de9d0c76-fa69-482f-9f6e-c74e8452aff5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5fb942145aaf908b5649aef075c89a473f9a3673311feec7329e4203c7a017c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Snowfro, Chromie Squiggle #1692, 2020.

What is the future for Snowfro after the Squiggle?\n\n\u200dS: I\u2019m both incredibly excited and also terrified about creating another work because of what\u2019s happened with Chromie Squiggles. Originally, they were a proof of concept rather than an art form, but over time they became a recognizable thing that I\u2019m now incredibly proud of. They were meant to be sweet and simple and clean, and they made people smile. But they were also created without any pressure, and I do think that creativity becomes infinitely more difficult under pressure. \n\nA year ago, I had never been introduced as an artist, so the pressure of what comes next is significant. And I\u2019m sure I can surpass it because I\u2019m terrified to disappoint. I\u2019m driven to innovate and be impactful by making sure that everyone who knows the Chromie Squiggle has the chance to own the next project. And it feels weird to exclude anybody, but at the same time it is incredibly difficult to create a generative edition of more than 1,000 iterations.

I figured it was just a matter of time.\n\n\u200dJB: So how did you get started in generative art?\n\n\u200dTH: I started to get really serious about being an artist in my early 20s, after studying Computer Science at UT (The University of Texas). I started working as a programmer after school at a tech startup in Austin, working on a database engine, which was a really fun job. But I was always working on artwork in my spare time. \n\nEventually, I knew that the artwork needed to be more personal and needed to involve my skill set. Programming was such a big part of my life, it really molded how I thought about the world in terms of patterns and processes. So I figured I needed to involve that programming in my artwork in some way. I made a few failed attempts at integrating math into my drawings and paintings \u2014 mathematical concepts and equations, and some other bad things like paintings of coding environments. \n\nI didn\u2019t know about generative art at the time, or I didn\u2019t know what it was formally. Maybe the closest references I knew were things like screensavers, or a couple of digital artists here and there. But it didn\u2019t seem like a real possibility to me. I asked myself: \u201cI wonder if I can write a program that creates a painting?\u201d \n\n\u200d\n\n\nTyler Hobbs, Careless and Well-Intentioned #1, 2022. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200d\n\nI\u2019d been doing these mathematical drawings by hand \u2014 very tedious, very laborious. And I was wondering: \u201cCan I just cut out the middleman and have the program do this stuff directly?\u201d So I started putting together some works with Matplotlib, hacking it a little bit to create my first generative art. And then later I found out about Processing and Casey Reas and the whole tradition and started to educate myself more.\n\n\u200dJB: It sounds like you went through the struggle of finding it yourself, inventing it in your own way. When you discovered Casey and the Processing community, what was that moment like for you, as someone trying to put your finger on this thing that you want to do? \n\n\u200dTH: It was really interesting. First of all, I was glad that there was better software because Matplotlib is not a great tool set. But to see someone like Casey who was able to talk about the connections that went all the way back to the 1960s, about the traditions of the art form, and the ways it\u2019s related to other traditional artists like Sol Lewitt. To me, it was super valuable to understand the work within a larger art historical context.\n\nI was fortunate enough to see him talk at UT for a mural that he was installing. He talked about his process, about how he thinks about curation, and what he thinks is special about generative art. Definitely, his thoughts were very influential for me getting started. On the other hand, I felt lucky that I had at least done my first works with my own naive approach, because I think that helped set me up with a little bit of an independent mental space of the type of work that I was trying to do. Rather than coming at it from a computational direction I was coming at it from a painting direction. I think that was really beneficial for me.\n\n\u200d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3519, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c5dac93-f52b-408d-9efe-9d50cfca3224": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c5dac93-f52b-408d-9efe-9d50cfca3224", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c1468275-689e-4481-a7a6-d33df5dd9986", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b6624e7a1f1bb5cac4ff3fdcb75454f97aa44b114fa116914b04c4d0d32f57a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b7f8ce5a-4dfc-4016-9a35-d768624b1c99", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5fdb48c883fe2735c135eb0d41307c31acef4d1f38655ef8c28a713996543f6d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a4ea86a-157a-4995-a3b3-f80b35584294", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2062e508efd334673edd13f6d34da411c5c817404d42a12cf0fd8e5f67e01007", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Tyler Hobbs, Incomplete Control #90, 2022. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200d\u200d\n\nJB: In my masters program, which was a digital art program, I had an older professor who said that the problem with generative art or digital art is that there\u2019s no entropy, no accident. You just program it in and then it produces what you ask it to do. But as someone with a painting background, for me the two couldn\u2019t be more alike. I\u2019m curious about how similar or dissimilar your creative process as a painter is relative to your coding. Are they more similar than most people realize?\n\n\u200dTH: By deeply involving randomness in the program, you\u2019re inviting accidents to happen constantly. But beyond that, no coder is perfect, right? Often you write code that\u2019s buggy, or you accidentally change the wrong number or something like that. And you get really bizarre results from the program. I\u2019m certain that almost every generative artist has experienced that multiple times. And it\u2019s highly relatable to kicking a paint can that splatters on the canvas and does something that really surprises you. It\u2019s almost more prone to accidents than painting and drawing. \n\nIt took me a while to make the mental shift from thinking about one particular output to thinking in terms of an entire output space. My first generative works were more like constructing a singular image, which is what you do when you\u2019re creating a painting. But generative art requires this shift to thinking in terms of the entire process and the entire system. That\u2019s the biggest shift between painting and generative art for me.\n\n\u200d\n\n\nTyler Hobbs, F(l)ight #3, 2021. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200d\u200d\n\nJB: Some people separate AI artists from generative artists. I tend to think of them all under the same family tree, maybe as cousins. But a lot of the artists I talk to actually think of the algorithm, or the code, as the art. So while they will exhibit or, in some cases, sell the output; to them, their baby, their creation, is actually the code which produces near infinite outputs. So where do you put the emphasis as an artist? Where is the art? Is it the code or the output? \n\n\u200dTH: For me, while it depends on the exact algorithm, the art is typically the entire output space rather than the code. Why do I say that? I consider myself a visual artist and coding is a means to get there. It\u2019s like the difference between saying that a painting is the canvas and the pigment. Yes, technically it is, but it\u2019s also the visual result. \n\nTo me, the code is not so interesting by itself. I don\u2019t care if the code is clean or particularly novel or anything like that. Really, it\u2019s about the potential visual output space of the generative program. That\u2019s what excites me. \nI\u2019ll also say that, for many generative works, curation is a very important part of the process. Sometimes you\u2019re putting works out directly with no curation, but it\u2019s common as well to curate the work from the algorithm. So I might generate 1,000 images and curate it down to five, which is what I did for a recent set of work. And that\u2019s also an artistic and challenging part of the process. You have to spend a lot of time thinking about how you best capture the full range of expression from the algorithm \u2014 the best parts of it \u2014 to show that variety without making it overly repetitive. So, in some cases, the artwork is the full output set from the program and, in other cases, I think that the final curated output is really the work because that curation is an artistic step in the process.\u200d\n\nJB: Which leads me to this idea of \u201clong-form\u201d generative art, which I don\u2019t think I\u2019d heard before reading your article. Did you coin that phrase to describe what\u2019s going on with Art Blocks and fxhash?\n\n\u200dTH: So I felt like what was happening with Art Blocks, particularly at the time and now with fxhash and maybe other platforms, was that there was really a new branch of generative art that was starting to happen. Artists were working in a way that felt fairly distinct to me from the generative art that I had myself created and observed before. \n\nAnd so I came up with this term \u201clong-form\u201d to try to capture what I thought I was seeing happen. And in that essay, I focused on two points. One is that rather than generating a handful of images we\u2019re generating hundreds or over a thousand images from the same algorithm and expecting all of them to be interesting. So that\u2019s a really large output size for a generative algorithm. \n\n\u200d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3522, "end_char_idx": 7971, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a4ea86a-157a-4995-a3b3-f80b35584294": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a4ea86a-157a-4995-a3b3-f80b35584294", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c1468275-689e-4481-a7a6-d33df5dd9986", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b6624e7a1f1bb5cac4ff3fdcb75454f97aa44b114fa116914b04c4d0d32f57a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c5dac93-f52b-408d-9efe-9d50cfca3224", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "423819478bc45f2a3a33f30d79396af8ffc50293850b13a4f1d1c76b1481c125", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "44bcbe48-874a-474d-8bbb-6d3a04811c44", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "59addc8a918f1666d5fd75c027404799b9f389cd776dde47eaec26e7f266da41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Tyler Hobbs, Fidenza #553, 2021. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200d\n\nThe second aspect that I thought was really interesting and affected the work was around removing that curation step. So with Art Blocks, the output from the algorithm goes directly into the hands of the collector in the form of an NFT. There\u2019s no opportunity for curation or cherry-picking by the artist or the platform or the collector. This also kind of creates a need for a very high consistency of quality in the output \u2014 you don\u2019t want bad outputs going to your collectors. \n\nSo I feel like this combination of needing to produce a lot of variety for this large output set and this high bar for the average quality of that output is a really interesting challenge for artists. I feel like a lot of the works that came out in 2021 broke new ground in terms of generative art. There are certainly some precedents such as live interactive generative programs where you can click to generate new outputs. But, to me, it really feels like there\u2019s something distinct about the way all those outputs are kind of captured and immortalized in the NFT platforms of Art Blocks and fxhash.\n\n\u200dJB: I think we have similar backgrounds in terms of starting in analog and moving to digital. We also both look up to some of the abstract painters of the 20th century. But I wonder whether that holds us back in our concept of art, because maybe the most obvious thing that software can do is be dynamic and interactive. Are we not being a bit skeuomorphic and nostalgic in the work that we\u2019re creating that, aesthetically at least, looks kind of like hard-edged abstraction? Even though we\u2019ve got this medium that allows for so much more, we\u2019re still preoccupied with static images. How do you think about that?\n\n\u200dTH: I think about this a lot as well. At a high level, I absolutely want to use the computer to break new ground \u2014 to do things that could never be done before. I think it would be a waste to stay in the realm of what could always be done by hand. And there are many ways you can do that. It doesn\u2019t have to be animated or interactive, though programming does make that much easier. \n\nFor me, I\u2019ve always just connected and resonated most strongly with static 2D imagery. If I go to a museum or gallery, that\u2019s just the kind of work that has always spoken to me. And so I feel personally pretty comfortable focusing on that for my own work. The paintings that have always spoken to me have a strong stylistic influence on my work as well. \nBut I know that by working through the computer, through programming, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that this is taking the work into a new area. And I think it\u2019s totally okay to draw inspiration from the choices of colors, textures, forms, and structures of these painters that we really enjoy and admire, and to re-examine those ideas through the lens of algorithmic creation. I think this is a really interesting remix. \n\nI also think that often art is most effective whenever it helps to create a bridge between the old and the new. Sometimes if work is entirely new, it doesn\u2019t create enough of a starting point for the viewer to grasp what\u2019s happening and to engage with it. And I think sometimes the work can engage the viewer more successfully if it uses more comfortable, relatable aspects. So I definitely don\u2019t have a problem with using my work as a bridge from the old to the new.\n\n\u200d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7974, "end_char_idx": 11367, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44bcbe48-874a-474d-8bbb-6d3a04811c44": {"__data__": {"id_": "44bcbe48-874a-474d-8bbb-6d3a04811c44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c1468275-689e-4481-a7a6-d33df5dd9986", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b6624e7a1f1bb5cac4ff3fdcb75454f97aa44b114fa116914b04c4d0d32f57a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a4ea86a-157a-4995-a3b3-f80b35584294", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2062e508efd334673edd13f6d34da411c5c817404d42a12cf0fd8e5f67e01007", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Tyler Hobbs, Fidenza #460, 2021. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200d\u200d\n\nJB: I\u2019m curious as to how you think about postmodernism, which was really about acknowledging that there are all these things in the world that go beyond art for art\u2019s sake. Indeed, there are people who would argue that art\u2019s job in a time like this is really to grapple with all of the social, political, and existential issues that surround us right now. Would you take offense to the claim that most generative art, maybe your generative art, is art for art\u2019s sake? How do we justify or explain what we\u2019re making when the traditional art world has in many ways moved on?\n\n\u200dTH: You\u2019re absolutely right and it\u2019s definitely a question that I think every artist should be thinking about. I think it\u2019s totally fair for artists who so wish to use their art to address climate change or other systemic woes. I don\u2019t think that every artist needs to concern themselves with those things, nor do I think every artist is necessarily capable of effectively concerning themselves with those things. But I do think it\u2019s important to have a meaning and a philosophical tribe behind your work. \n\nHere\u2019s what I think is the value of my work and of generative art in general. You know, every day we\u2019re spending more and more time in a digital environment. All of the tools and interfaces that we use are being constructed with code by teams of programmers. And so we\u2019re really starting to live in this programmatic environment. And most of that software is built by corporations who have a goal of essentially extracting money from you, right? I don\u2019t begrudge them for doing that but that\u2019s just the facts. \n\n\u200d\n\n\nTyler Hobbs, Marfa Mural, Marfa, TX, 2021. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200d\n\nIt\u2019s so important to me that we have artists working with those same materials, and that it\u2019s not just people with commercial goals that are driving all of our software. Artists of the 20th century found this need to concern themselves with the building blocks of the day, whether it was Carl Andre using bricks or other artists using concrete or steel or glass. They found it imperative to work with the same materials that we find all around us in our daily life. And they asked a number of questions: \u201cHow can we take these same materials and bend them for artistic purposes? How can we make our environment more enjoyable and humane? How can we make it more ecologically friendly?\u201d\n\nAnd so I think code needs the exact same treatment. I think we need to develop a way to play with code and a way to create beautiful things with code, a way to create humane, expressive things with code. And the wonderful thing about code is that it\u2019s also incredibly scalable. So I think that the benefit of doing this type of artistic exploration could have some really wonderful payouts for many digital and software environments. There\u2019s also just so much fresh, unexplored territory. I think it\u2019s fine to be a little bit selfish as an artist to really enjoy your medium.

Generative art acknowledges that and celebrates it in a way that maybe other traditional art forms simply haven\u2019t yet. \n\n\u200dTH: Yeah, the universe is generative, and everything that\u2019s happening around us is a result of these processes, right? They might be really complex processes \u2014 weather systems and geological systems \u2014 guided by the laws of physics and chemistry, but nature is process driven. Thinking in terms of systems and processes is a really beautiful way to analyze and appreciate the world around us. As generative artists, we talk a lot about emergence.

I\u2019m guessing the majority of people consume your work on their laptop or their phone. How do you feel about that as an artist? What level of control do you want to have? \n\n\u200dTH: The format of display and the context of display are crucial for our work. It\u2019s a little bit tough as a digital artist that I lose a lot of control over how people are viewing the work. As you mentioned, probably quite a few people are seeing my work on a cell phone screen. And that\u2019s such a difficult environment because, first of all, the image is tiny, with limited resolution, and the color accuracy might not be great. Sometimes I try to take that into account when designing the work, to make it robust at smaller scales. But as the artist, anytime that I can have more control, to guarantee a better viewing experience, I always want to take that. \n\nFor my work in particular, prints are often the highest quality way to view the work. I think people don\u2019t really appreciate the gulf in resolution between prints and even something like a 4K monitor. Prints still just totally blow our best digital displays out of the water. I can also guarantee color accuracy and any sort of texture or lighting elements as well. So, for me, prints are the highest tier of display for work that\u2019s digital in origin. I do love to create plotter drawings \u2014 works on paper that involve drawing and painting. I love how analog media has this infinite richness and detail to it. So the closer you look, the more interesting things you can find to enjoy, which is often not the case for digital work. \n\nI think there\u2019s something special and really curious about taking algorithmic forms and producing them in an analog way. The downside is only people who can see it in person get to enjoy that full experience. The internet just has massive reach, and probably 100 or 1,000 times the number of people are going to be able to see a work as a digital image versus seeing it in person. So there\u2019s this breadth versus quality trade-off that one has to make.\n\u200dJB: I know from going to your site that you take documentation of your process and the work pretty seriously. Could you say something about that and also about the role of writing as a complement to your art-making process?\n\n\u200dTH: I\u2019ve discovered over time that documenting the process helps people to appreciate the work so much more. I think this is largely an artifact of generative art being new to so many viewers. I had this experience with studio tours in Austin a few years ago where 200 or so people would come in every day, look at the work, and we\u2019d talk about it. Probably 99 percent of them had never heard of generative art before. But I could see, as I was explaining it, that they got it. \n\nWhile work has to be good in the first place, documentation can deepen that. So part of my desire to document came from this repeated experience of seeing that effect on people. I also initially started documenting my process for the benefit of other artists, as I wanted to try to expand the art form. These days, I think other people probably do a better job of that, so I\u2019m a little bit more focused on explaining the philosophy and artistic intentions behind my work to allow viewers to better understand it.\n\n\u200d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1654, "end_char_idx": 5066, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a095e6f-a8a6-47a0-b815-c92e47c0b89c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a095e6f-a8a6-47a0-b815-c92e47c0b89c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8eb39da5-b446-4bfe-a41c-14116ee89463", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c04c035acac4cf797796e9cba455076cb55d7395f1d94c9f1957a6bd16c79078", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a052546b-8485-414d-a618-9b1b3d670e52", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6a9a328b6db9e48def5ef844155fff2277a93f7c871be4447fc927936ca57c54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c15dacc8-8bd5-4303-abc0-8e28e200bf95", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d13ba62ce1cb3ba75c88f362131bd6b6d903d297341f6df408a827d978b1d1a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Tyler in the Studio, 2022.

A lot of people make the argument that art should stand on its own, but I think that\u2019s rubbish. Art is not made in a vacuum, it\u2019s made by a human and one\u2019s knowledge about that human and the context of their prior practice informs one\u2019s response to the work. On the other hand, if you have to explain everything about the art, you\u2019ve almost undressed it and there\u2019s nothing left to the imagination. I think people expect that because I come from a family of engineers that I have a multi-step process for collecting or assessing art. But within the first millisecond, I\u2019m either in love or I\u2019m bored. And then if I\u2019m in love, I want to learn all these other things about the context. \n\n\u200dTH: There is a sliding scale, with conceptualism pitted against, say, expressionism. I think the more conceptual a work is, the more completely it might be captured by writing. Seeing Duchamp\u2019s Fountain (1917) doesn\u2019t tell you anything about the work. You basically have to read about it in order to get it. But with visual artwork \u2014 while I agree that understanding the artist and their body of work is very important \u2014 I also compare it to music. \n\nI have a background studying guitar and drumming and playing in bands, which shapes my thinking about my visual artwork. We don\u2019t feel the same need to provide context about music or to analyze it through a conceptual lens. Somehow we\u2019re much more sensual, instinctual, and intuitive when it comes to our experience of music. I would love for viewers to be able to enjoy my visual artwork in a similar way, and then to deepen their understanding and appreciation via the context, if they choose to.\n\u200dJB: How, in your view, do the affordances of generative art shape its aesthetic? \n\n\u200dTH: They have a massive influence on it. First of all, the computer can work tirelessly. It doesn\u2019t complain about drawing millions of tiny lines, or tiny dots, or super precise placements. It can create works that, from a labor perspective, would not be accessible by hand. So that\u2019s one area of new territory that generative art can access.\n\n\u200d\n\n\nTyler Hobbs, Fidenza #430, 2021. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200d\n\nComputers are engineered from top to bottom to be as predictable and reliable and exact as possible. Every single thing about the stack is engineered that way. And so by default, everything that comes out of a program is going to be rigid and precise, exactly as you would expect it. So that has a large implication for the artwork, which is almost the opposite of creating work by hand where everything by default is flawed. Try and draw the straightest line you can by hand and it\u2019s going to be wobbly and messy. \n\nBut let\u2019s take the example of looping, which is a core component of programming. Looping shows up visually in generative art over and over again, even just the idea of multiple iterations from a single program. Excessive repetition is an element that shows up in my work and that of many other generative artists as well. One component that\u2019s really interesting, which kind of counterbalances the others, is randomness. A computer is an amazing source of randomness. But because you can tune it to very specific probability distributions, you can get very controlled randomness from the computer. And I think this is a really interesting way for the artist to work in terms of fuzzy specifications. I think that has a large aesthetic impact as well.\n\n\u200dJB: What\u2019s the role of algorithms in your creative process?\n\n\u200dTH: I have definitely built my own toolkit of algorithms that I go back to over and over again. I\u2019ve never done anything with Voronoi breakdowns, which was once a really common thing, and I avoided Perlin noise for the first seven years of making generative art. But I also came up with my own circle-packing algorithm. \n\nMy thought was always: \u201cIf I\u2019m going to use the algorithm, I would really prefer to design it myself.\u201d An artist should have complete mastery over any tool that they use, and that\u2019s what will help to give them the most effective results in their work. So I\u2019ve chosen to mostly stick with algorithms that I can think up and implement myself. I\u2019m avoiding things like Navier-Stokes equations where I could never be a master of that \u2014 it might look pretty, but it doesn\u2019t seem like a good tool for creating my artwork. \n\n\u200d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5069, "end_char_idx": 9484, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c15dacc8-8bd5-4303-abc0-8e28e200bf95": {"__data__": {"id_": "c15dacc8-8bd5-4303-abc0-8e28e200bf95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8eb39da5-b446-4bfe-a41c-14116ee89463", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c04c035acac4cf797796e9cba455076cb55d7395f1d94c9f1957a6bd16c79078", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a095e6f-a8a6-47a0-b815-c92e47c0b89c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c1596606bf0a2cbfe006985083547c9537657a3cbcd2eff8db9cefeae786267b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b91c823f-141a-4d6f-9c69-840b73258747", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d7c2004fa254d06bc4b1132c9ff31b5f909723f4041cedd135c44ceafb2fd82", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Tyler at \u201cIncomplete Control\u201d, 2021. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200d\n\nI\u2019ve tried to avoid reading too much about the standard bag of algorithms, just because I\u2019ve seen them get worked so much. But at this point, I definitely have my own standard algorithms that I go back to again and again. I\u2019ve written about flow fields and all of the different ways that I\u2019ve found them to be useful. But when I\u2019m creating a work, I often don\u2019t have an end point in mind, only a starting point. I want to avoid having a blank canvas. And I trust that during the artistic process of exploration that I can discover something interesting. \n\nI often start by asking: \u201cWhat if I take a flow field and twist and disturb it in this way?\u201d And I might write up a quick version of that algorithm, play with it, see what it looks like, and then, based on what I\u2019m seeing, start to alter it. I might not even need flow fields. Or I might be looking at a work and think it could use some fine textures, so l might use circle packing to create some textural elements. I feel totally comfortable using these algorithms over and over again. I think as an artist, it\u2019s really helpful for your productivity not to reinvent the wheel every single time you create a new work. It\u2019s nice that I have flow fields, for example, as a dependable way to achieve certain things because it allows me to focus my artistic thoughts elsewhere.\n\n\u200dJB: One could make an analogy with musical scales, which are an inherent infrastructure that everyone uses to write songs but which aren\u2019t an end in themselves.\n\n\u200dTH: Absolutely. Musicians use standard scales and chord progressions all the time. But they\u2019re such a basic part of what goes into the work that they don\u2019t make the work what it truly is.\n\n\u200d\n\n\nTyler Hobbs, Fidenza #889, 2021. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200d\u200d\n\nJB: Figures like Casey Reas, Ben Fry, as well as Joshua Davis have shaped a culture of open-source code. But now that generative art is big business, have you seen that put a chill on open sourcing at all?\n\n\u200dTH: Unfortunately, I have seen more of a lockdown in terms of code. I\u2019ve definitely heard from many prominent artists that they no longer open source their code, because people would take that code, use it to generate their set of entities and then essentially sell another artist\u2019s work, which is an inappropriate use. \n\nSome people feel very strongly that the code is the artwork. And even though I have a slightly different take on it, I view the code as a very important component of the artwork. And I would prefer for viewers and collectors to be able to enjoy that. Historically, whenever I sold a print, I would include a printout of the source code as part of the package so they could at least enjoy that aspect of it. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be tough to figure out the ethics of what\u2019s acceptable. Perhaps artists may have to accept that this type of code reuse is going to happen. One also has to consider the practicalities of it. Say somebody takes the Fidenza (2021) algorithm off the blockchain and they change 25% of the code. There\u2019s a lot of fuzzy, gray territory there. And I don\u2019t have the answers. I would love for generative artists to be able to share the code more openly. But we definitely do have to acknowledge that there have also been problems recently with people doing unauthorized usages of that code.\n\n\u200d\n\nBased on requests from a segment of the community that was focused on this issue, Jason asked a follow-up question\u2026\n\u200d\n\nJB: A lot of people are upset that you filed DMCAs against work by other artists. What was the motivation behind those and how do you think about the line between protecting your work and fair use?\u200d\n\nTH: In the months since Fidenza was released, many NFT collections popped up that incorporated Fidenza in various ways, often prominently and without permission. My work is special to me, and something I\u2019ve worked a long time to create. I don\u2019t appreciate it when others take that work and use it commercially without asking. Fair use is a nuanced subject, but here are the primary factors I consider. \n\nFirst, is the use commercial? Second, was the work changed in a substantial and transformative way? Last, how much of the original work was used? The answers to these three questions guide my decisions about what is fair use, and they also have a legal basis, at least within US law. I wanted to properly spell out my thoughts on the subject and provide examples, so I recently put together this write-up that goes more in depth on the subject.\n\n\u200d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9487, "end_char_idx": 14007, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b91c823f-141a-4d6f-9c69-840b73258747": {"__data__": {"id_": "b91c823f-141a-4d6f-9c69-840b73258747", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8eb39da5-b446-4bfe-a41c-14116ee89463", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c04c035acac4cf797796e9cba455076cb55d7395f1d94c9f1957a6bd16c79078", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c15dacc8-8bd5-4303-abc0-8e28e200bf95", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d13ba62ce1cb3ba75c88f362131bd6b6d903d297341f6df408a827d978b1d1a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "db0b1614-ab7f-4719-8a83-52e80acdfbfe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "30d85c9a5707d2129d389334d6b4d865e1778f2866f0b2e23c00ff38458431ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Tyler Hobbs, Fidenza #450, 2021.

I think NFTs gave generative art a platform and visibility at exactly the right time. I think we\u2019re fortunate that generative art is seeing a third wave of artists who are creating new and, in my opinion, particularly high-quality work. \n\nI think the generative art these days is by far the best that I\u2019ve ever seen. And it\u2019s nice that it coincided with NFTs becoming popular. Blockchain technology also marries very nicely with generative art in a lot of ways \u2014 Art Blocks being one particularly good example of that. \nIn general, I think NFTs are incredibly important for digital artists of all kinds. There hasn\u2019t been a time before now when digital artists could really make a living off their work. I think you can make a pretty easy case for digital art being more relevant to this time than painting is. And so I think it\u2019s wonderful that digital artists can earn their living now with NFTs.\n\n\u200dJB: Is there a threshold where the adulation becomes more about the hype than the art itself? And have we reached that threshold in generative art?\n\n\u200dTH: There are absolutely times and places where it\u2019s gone way beyond what it should be. It\u2019s very easy to point to the late summer of 2021 as a moment where hype outstripped artistic merit, or when there was such a large inflow of money that it attracted lots of people for monetary rather than artistic reasons. I think we\u2019ve seen that slowly recede since then which has felt to me like a very healthy change. I think things went way too far.\n\nI\u2019m definitely very grateful to be in the position I am where I\u2019ve benefited tremendously from that. It\u2019s given me the means to establish myself as an artist, and to work comfortably for the rest of my life. But there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that there\u2019s a more healthy balance that I would love to see \u2014 more of a focus on the art and less of a focus on the money, people behaving sanely and rationally and not viewing artwork as a speculative investment. But I think that NFTs create a great opportunity for patrons to support and share the work of digital artists. I think it\u2019s just going to take time for that hype cycle to play out fully, to get to a more healthy plateau.\n\n\u200d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 14010, "end_char_idx": 16398, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db0b1614-ab7f-4719-8a83-52e80acdfbfe": {"__data__": {"id_": "db0b1614-ab7f-4719-8a83-52e80acdfbfe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8eb39da5-b446-4bfe-a41c-14116ee89463", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c04c035acac4cf797796e9cba455076cb55d7395f1d94c9f1957a6bd16c79078", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b91c823f-141a-4d6f-9c69-840b73258747", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d7c2004fa254d06bc4b1132c9ff31b5f909723f4041cedd135c44ceafb2fd82", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "437e1d50-726c-41d8-af0f-9078cbaf04ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea31a091b7d3b882498f2756226c140018bd15c39939a6e49b5325b775a51e91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Tyler in the Studio, 2022.

I\u2019ve always loved his work. Just the graphic quality, and the way he works with color is mind-blowing. I consider color to be one of the most challenging aspects of generative artwork, and I think Kjetil does an amazing job with that. \n\nI think phase (2021) by Loren Bednar was really amazing as an animated work. I mentioned earlier that I often don\u2019t feel super engaged by animated work. But I thought this was just really special. That was the first long-form animated work that I thought was really successful. Ringers (2021), of course, is legendary for really paving the way for what can be done, and I think Dmitri Cherniak deserves mad props for that. \n\nSome of the stuff that\u2019s come out more recently has been really amazing: Thomas Lin Pederson\u2019s Screens (2022); Ben Kovach\u2019s Edifice (2021); William Mapan\u2019s Anticyclone (2022); Emily Xie\u2019s Memories of Qilin (2022). It\u2019s really exciting to see within the Art Blocks scene all these artists learning from each other and challenging each other to up their game.

In the past, I have used town names for the titles of my works. I do that because I often don\u2019t want the title to have a strong influence on the way that the viewer initially perceives the work. And so I like to sometimes have a more neutral title. Town names work well for that because it\u2019s already a name, it can do the job well, and so in the past I used Texan town names. But when I was working on Fidenza (2021), I looked around Texas as much as I could but couldn\u2019t find a town name that really seemed like a fit so I panned over to Italy and the town of Fidenza stood out as a really cool name, so I went with that.\n\n\u200d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 16401, "end_char_idx": 18695, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "437e1d50-726c-41d8-af0f-9078cbaf04ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "437e1d50-726c-41d8-af0f-9078cbaf04ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8eb39da5-b446-4bfe-a41c-14116ee89463", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c04c035acac4cf797796e9cba455076cb55d7395f1d94c9f1957a6bd16c79078", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "db0b1614-ab7f-4719-8a83-52e80acdfbfe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "30d85c9a5707d2129d389334d6b4d865e1778f2866f0b2e23c00ff38458431ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Tyler Hobbs, AGNES, 2020.

It is not an exhaustive attempt to explain its roots nor any scholarly truth. \n\nI\u2019ve dedicated myself full-time to generative art for the last year, having played with it for over 25. From my early coding experiments as a teenager to brief encounters with generative music, to parametric design in architecture, there is something magical about establishing a set of rules and playing around with them before seeing things emerge. For me, this is both a directed, rational play as well as a random exploration of rules and parameters.\n\nMost of what I know of art history, and generative art in particular, I have learnt in recent years. One can trace the influence of Vera Molnar, Herbert W. Franke, Charles Csuri and Georg Nees, amongst other early practitioners, in works of today\u2019s generative artists. DaLenz\u2019s Aerial View (2021) and Tyler Hobbs\u2019s F(l)ight (2021) seem to me to reimagine certain concepts developed by Molnar and Csuri through new media and formats.\n\n\u200d\n\n\nLeft: Charles Csuri, Hummingbird II, 1967. Right: Tyler Hobbs, F(l)ight, 2021\n\n\nFor my part, I find inspiration in a number of modernist movements from the early twentieth century, notably Orphism and Suprematism. The geometrical nature and color exploration of these works lend themselves to generative art\u2019s will-to-expansion via broad parameter ranges. I see traces of Kandinsky, Sonia and Robert Delaunay, Hilma Af Klint, Franti\u0161ek Kupka, Francis Picabia, and others in my work, and I draw heavy inspiration from this era, both consciously and unconsciously. My first experiments with a pen plotter were attempts at Suprematist compositions.\n\n\u200d\n\n\nMarcelo Soria-Rodriguez, Suprematist generative compositions, 2020, pastel and marker on paper\n\n\nFor \u201cEntretiempos,\u201d my latest project released as part of Art Blocks Curated, the output images appear as distant relatives of Kupka, Af Klint and Sonia Delaunay. References to the latter are deliberate, since the project was born of a desire to emulate that style and expand its possibilities through generative processes.\n\n\u200d\n\n\nLeft: Sonia Delauney, Prismes \u00e9lectriques, 1914. Right: Marcelo Soria-Rodriguez, Entretiempos #596, \u201creveal\u201d version, 2022\n\n\nThe computer tools of the late 1980s and early 90s heavily influenced my current practice: Both the Macromedia Flash community and the demo scene of that period. Glitch and pixel aesthetics, so prominent in digital art today, also resonate with me and return me unconsciously to those early explorations. I\u2019ve used \u201cProcessing\u201d \u2014 the programming language developed by Casey Reas and Ben Fry \u2014 for casual sketching since 2004, and it remains my primary tool of artistic expression.\n\nMusic also influences my work. Generative art can be either figurative or abstract, and instrumental music shapes my own works of abstraction. Minimalists, from John Cage to Steve Reich, were exploring generative concepts in the 1960s at the very moment that computer art was emerging. Philip Glass has also had a strong influence on both my visual and (poor) musical production. \n\nEven the works of JS Bach might be loosely regarded as geometrical generative practice \u2014 A set of given rules followed by an exploration of combinations and parameters. Take Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme BWV 140 (also known as \u201cSleeper\u2019s Wake\u201d, 1731). As I re-listen to its first movement in a recording by Karl Richter, I see geometrical shapes emerging and engaging in an orchestrated evolution across the canvas.

I haven\u2019t explored this realm much in my own practice as yet, but it is alluring to me as it sits naturally alongside my long-standing interest in neuroscience. This led me in my corporate years \u2014 devoted to innovation and strategy \u2014 to ponder the dissimilarities between human cognition and artificial intelligence, and to engage the question of what is cognition and what it means to be human. \n\nHow do we relate at an emotional level to masterpieces of computer-assisted art, and to works of total machine creation? What will such pieces look like when machines start to share the capacity for intention? At the moment, our algorithms are programmed deterministically or trained non-deterministically on a set of data. But no current AI has free will. It does what we tell it or train it to do. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to me to consider the training sets that we employ for tasks involving machine cognition: Predicting the precise time an airplane will land to deploy ground services, optimizing marketing campaigns, predicting natural disasters, pre-empting protein folding, producing deepfakes, not to mention creating works of art. Such datasets are the stimuli of a newborn child, experiences which cohere that child\u2019s cognition and emotion. Are we feeding our algorithms the right mix of human input for them to recreate a model of our world that is compatible with humanity? \n\nGenerative art has a critical role in this respect in its capacity to encode beauty, emotions, critique, and thought. We are coding approximate reproductions of our own aesthetic responses. The exploration of parameter space in a generative artwork yields many possibilities for the algorithm, probing the corners of its total cognitive space (a concept I have written about previously). Artists are presently engaged in exploring the human response to those outputs, alongside a machine\u2019s comprehension of our interests. This shows in the breadth of their parameters. \n\nIn \u201cEntretiempos\u201d I take as my base premise concentric rings that intersect, generating particular shapes through an exploration of radius size, ring clusters, paint types (solid fill, lines, outline), background colors, paint precision and more. This yields a rich space of possibility, provoking one\u2019s reactions whilst also leaving one unmoved.\n\n\u200d\n\n\nMarcelo Soria-Rodriguez, Entretiempos #118, #460, #395, 2022\n\u200d\n\nWe encounter a plethora of themes in generative art today, especially since the launch of long-form generative platforms like Art Blocks and, more recently, fxhash. The number of generative projects is currently exploding, yielding a myriad of approaches along with a broad catalogue of subjects. Together, this creative field is fertile terrain for future machine consciousness to analyze us and recalibrate its relationship. \n\nProjects like Botto, fueled by Mario Klingemann\u2019s AI machinery, are interesting because they tie market value to the cognitive core of an \u201cautonomous AI artist.\u201d This develops feedback loops between the human world \u2014 whose tastes are expressed through acquisitions, community voting, and valuations \u2014 and the very neural networks that create the works.\n\nWe are physical entities, biological beings that derive from a world of dirt and noisy imperfection. Machines, however, can produce perfection, or rather can achieve a degree of precision in movement and measurement that far surpasses our own. However, our emotional responses and our appreciation of beauty have been trained on an imperfect, biological world. How do we humans respond to works of art that lack the inherent dirt of our material sphere? \n\nIt is interesting to me that once we had developed digital media (CDs, etc.) to record our musical expressions there emerged a \u201clo-fi\u201d movement that sought to reclaim white noise, distortion, and imperfection. Recently, we\u2019ve borne witness to a huge body of work produced according to error, to the aesthetics of \u201cglitch.\u201d In \u201cEntretiempos,\u201d I have explored this issue by incorporating certain parameters that regulate the noise inflecting an algorithm\u2019s creative process. Should a viewer wish for an image of \u201cmachine precision\u201d then they may reset all noise to zero, and then decide which version they respond to more intensely.\n\n\u200d\n\n\nMarcelo Soria-Rodriguez, Entretiempos #674, 2022.

Marraccini discusses the work of Micha\u00ebl Zancan and Matt DesLauriers, two emerging stars of a generative renaissance\n\nCredit: Zancan, Lushtemples \u2014 Ars Ex Naturae Ex, 2021\nNow Reading:  \nOn the New Evolution of Generative Art\nIn the crypto art world, where a week is a year, there is a strange preoccupation with the narrative of the \u201cOG.\u201d The abbreviation stands for \u201cOriginal Gangster,\u201d which is both hilarious and telling. After all, some of the most sustained attention work minted as NFTs receives is from streetwear and culture sites like Hypebeast. But the \u201cOG\u201d in this case is the breakout star of the first wave of any particular form of crypto art. For generative art, this is most often cited as Tyler Hobbs, whose \u201cFidenza\u201d series minted on the Ethereum blockchain has netted over $177 million in sales. \n\n\u201cFidenza,\u201d however, is indebted to the process art movements of the 1960s and 70s, particularly the geometric and instructional interests of Sol LeWitt, whom Hobbs references in his own graphite grid sketches. Yet that same historical moment also saw the emergence, not in the mainstream gallery star system but in experimental labs and methodologies courses, of plotter art. Plotter art uses a computer-directed arm with a pen holder to draw lines pre-dictated by code. Early works were done on laboratory networks running text-only interfaces, with standout pieces by Vera Molnar (who started working with computers in 1968) and Manfred Mohr generating complexity from initially simple geometric algorithms. If there\u2019s any OG here, the genealogy is long and complex, and runs back at least fifty years. \n\n\u200d\n\n\nInstallation view, \u201cCode of Arms\u201d with works by Vera Molnar and Manfred Mohr, 2021. Courtesy Gazelli Art House\n\u200d\n\nPlotter art has seen something of a resurgence in the more experimental generative NFT art circles. While NFT-to-print services on Ethereum have emerged for higher-priced pieces like those on Art Blocks, Tezos artists on emerging platforms like fxhash initially offered plotter printing of generative works at a cost. Although all the works generated are theoretically reproducible by a plotter, they don\u2019t physically exist unless a token holder explicitly orders one matching their NFT. Further, the hash code of the minted token supplies the pseudo-random generative factor of the art, which is in sum any physical piece ultimately produced, the whole series of generated images, and the generating code itself (usually p5 JavaScript or Hydra). This dance between materiality and non-fungibility is of interest to both artists and collectors attracted to the form.\n\nAn early luminary of the Tezos chain generative scene is emerging artist Micha\u00ebl Zancan. A former oil painter from the South of France, Zancan has paintings from 2018 and earlier displayed on his personal website that are stunningly average \u2014 high fantasy run through a forest surrealism blender. Yet Zancan\u2019s plotter art, in two series on Objkt.com and fxhash respectively, is nothing if not extraordinary for its status as a stylistic outlier. Both Lushtemples and Garden, Monoliths (both 2021) feature ambiguous felled stone structures and ample, almost overwhelming foliage. To the initial, unstudied gaze, they defy the now-dated expectation of somehow \u201clooking algorithmic,\u201d seemingly composed with a painterly eye to balance and density. The sparing use of green Copic Marker and occasional colored paper as a ground gives them the quality of the handmade whilst also being a by-product of coded instruction.\n\n\u200d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3573, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad19742f-59a5-4276-a1f1-d80a829e256b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad19742f-59a5-4276-a1f1-d80a829e256b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ddfff922-50c2-4114-b3e9-8d000bb5bea4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "15cc96ad16cf01f5b8c6692e533cc57b7fe9712678c46ae81771988977d96c0a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d58dcbcd-9bd5-4d3c-a601-bc7a5bc75eb6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f3984452cee8dce8450fffa7350c10d9ca83a944641c3ac5f71d93dd465dd507", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "53a5b48e-1b59-445a-938f-9abefdc54182", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f76c82a8b12aa7c51e6e1ed757284724488add9b6d23707c60d8f6f00d8ebd39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Zancan, Lushtemples \u2014 The Stones which Stood, 2021\n\u200d\n\nZancan defies the genealogy of LeWitt, Mohr, and Molnar with wild abandon that neglects any pretense of geometric post-minimalism as output. Yet, implicitly, the methods behind Lushtemples and Garden, Monoliths are still a callback to the OGs of generative computer art, even if the outputs seem to defy the normal inorganic bent of these designs. Zancan himself describes the Lushtemples as \u201cfigurative generative art,\u201d and in looking closely at Lushtemples \u2014 The Stones Which Stood and Ars Ex Naturae Ex this is apt self-terminology. As the second title suggests, the artist works at the intersection of the mathematical and the natural, like the edges of Mandelbrot fractals or the unpredictable tailing digits of e or pi. In Ars Ex Naturae Ex, carefully delineated broken columns suggest Vitruvian classical forms, and in The Stones Which Stood, almost squared stones imply a fallen henge overgrown by time. The distinctions between artificial and natural material within the scenes is highlighted by use of gray for the man-made and green for the terrain and plants.\n\nIn this regard, Zancan has another \u201cOG\u201d to whom he is indebted \u2014 Hieronymus Cock, whose 16th-century prints of Roman ruins inspired a flowering of Baroque obsession with architecture quite literally gone to seed. The juxtaposition of ruined works of man alongside the ever-growing, omnipresent greenery of the landscape in Cock\u2019s work was often allegorical. In The Origins of German Tragic Drama (1928), Walter Benjamin characterizes the role of the ruin in this historical period as showing a new exuberance enabled by decay simultaneous with a wistful antiquarianism. Benjamin\u2019s ruins are fecund; so too are Zancan\u2019s \u2014 taking a period medium from early computing and populating it with new, leafy growth that overclimbs the geometric regularity of its tumbled structural past.\n\n\u200d\n\n\nZancan, Garden, Monoliths, 2021\n\u200d\n\nYet to evoke Benjamin here is dangerous. Perhaps his most famous essay, The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935) treats the introduction of the print as medium and the crisis it provoked in the world from the 15th to 17th centuries onward. For Benjamin, an \u201caura\u201d of individuality defines a single, individually-produced artwork that is not similarly invested in a print. Zancan\u2019s NFTs, themselves potential reproductions of not-yet-existent plotter drawings in ink, generated by an algorithm and in turn coded by an artist, are in many ways the Benjaminian nightmare of reproductive technology. Yet to see them is to be drawn in \u2014 it is undeniable that they have a compelling artistic worth. Is this an \u201caura\u201d? Can an infinitely reproducible digital work carry an \u201caura,\u201d and in the case of new plotter art in particular, is it more likely to have one because it is intrinsically linked to a physical medium on paper and ink?\n\nThese are the questions Lushtemples and Garden, Monoliths evoke in their long genealogy but also in their strident physical immediacy. Garden, Monoliths #3 features columns and long grasses that lean out of the frame toward the viewer, while others in the series, such as #249, have barely visible monoliths \u2014 only a glimpse of stone on a green ground that becomes an extension of the poppies, berry stems, and leaves that overwhelm the square frame. The crisp, rectangular monoliths of #181 suggest barely any decay at all. Perhaps a different amount of time has passed between each iteration. The pieces, to the untrained eye, could be sketches of ruins over many years and seasons. They seem to share an aura imparted by time. \n\n\u200d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3576, "end_char_idx": 7203, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53a5b48e-1b59-445a-938f-9abefdc54182": {"__data__": {"id_": "53a5b48e-1b59-445a-938f-9abefdc54182", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ddfff922-50c2-4114-b3e9-8d000bb5bea4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "15cc96ad16cf01f5b8c6692e533cc57b7fe9712678c46ae81771988977d96c0a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad19742f-59a5-4276-a1f1-d80a829e256b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed74a33955d84644a7d51812f0e692a48842b9936c8e6479f634aba1aa6fe9db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Matt DesLauriers, Meridian #883, 2021\n\u200d\n\nAn interesting study in contrast is the work of Matt DesLauriers, a more established figure in the generative art scene who has a long exhibition history predating the NFT form that includes plotter art. DesLauriers's work is not only formally but also conceptually polished; his own writing on the implication of NFTs for generative work is incisive and frames his artistic production. In two related pieces for Art Blocks: Meridian and Subscapes (both 2021), DesLauriers explores landscape and terrain. While Zancan\u2019s pieces might feel akin to Albrecht D\u00fcrer\u2019s Large Piece of Turf, a watercolor study from 1503, DesLauriers\u2019s work evokes D\u00fcrer\u2019s later landscape etchings with their exposed rock faces and complex, emotive layering of natural elements. DesLauriers\u2019s experience shows in the variety of his generative mints and in the way they nod to plotter art without being plottable. \n\n\u200dSubscapes, for instance, uses a square ground and inked style evocative of early plotter work but simultaneously well outside its capacities. It also shows considerable formal verve. It is a series of varying miniature terrain pieces in different colorways, styles, and gradients. The ground itself serves as a figure in the piece\u2019s figure-ground relationship, winking at the conventions of illustrative art. #53000626 uses square, semi-gridded patches to suggest cartographic space, while #53000629, generated by exactly the same algorithm with a different token hash, is almost entirely stippled, suggestive of hand drawing instead. The isometric perspective of each tiny landscape is a kind of God\u2019s-eye view that links back to metaphors of possession and mastery tied to 17th-century objects in the Wunderkammer. These, too, are Benjaminian themes. Here, aura is a kind of generated microcosm unique to each token owner. No two mints, by definition, are identical, even as they are, as digital images, technically almost infinitely reproducible. \n\n\u200d\n\n\nMatt DesLauriers, Subscapes #53000629, 2021\n\u200d\n\n\nMatt DesLauriers, Subscapes #53000298, 2021\n\u200d\n\nIn fact, each token of Subscapes is so distinctive that some move toward abstraction from figuration. While #53000555 can be read as a landscape paired with the piece\u2019s title, without it, one might not assume it has a direct referent in the natural world. An improbable cliff paired with a collage-like surface pattern produces art made to look like nature that itself looks a little artificial. What Zancan begins to explore in Ars Ex Naturae Ex, DesLauriers masters knowingly with simple gestures embedded in his code. The potential artifice of the natural landscape and the ways in which this shapes the trajectory of representation itself is also implicit in the neon colorways of Subscapes tokens #53000451, #53000436, and #53000298, to name only a few. Is Subscapes natural? Is it artificial? Yes. And yes. Matt DesLauriers\u2019s little worlds here prod both the nature-artifice line and that of reproducibility and uniqueness. \n\nIn keeping with their Benjaminian implications, then, both Zancan\u2019s early work and DesLauriers\u2019s foray into the NFT space, after years of plotter and digital art-making, share a concern with markers of naturalness and manufacture. In five months, when both artists are considered OGs in the crypto world, these pieces will feel almost classical to frequent buyers and viewers of generative art sites. In five years, when they are invariably included in a show of early work, they may feel like the beginning of a formal movement in natural algorithms that also raises questions about the state of artifice taking root. In fifty, perhaps they will feel like a LeWitt or Mohr \u2014 a methodological inflection point, both radiant and strange. Perhaps someday they will even be mounted next to another reproductive medium: An Early Modern print of ruins or mountainsides.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7206, "end_char_idx": 11085, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc340881-5662-4bbc-ab7c-2e7646d61a74": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc340881-5662-4bbc-ab7c-2e7646d61a74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6da9caad-c649-43a3-8267-c79bc49b850b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "574750e4d55191a7580789b4e509f589e9715648d7ca8280963288ad919c6cc0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a6c3d39-c873-4018-98f8-7abfd857f361", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7e34be1bf7188e1b518d297ad33429cd75cd3001fa155ca16fc8a4bdffd831df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Interview | Matt DesLauriers\nOne of the world\u2019s leading generative artists discusses the evolving digital landscape with Alex Estorick\n\nCredit: Matt DesLauriers, Filigree, 2024.

But where many of the algorithmic works I had created previously were shorter sketches, [this] was a significant endeavor. Something that many generative artists will share is that, before the crypto art market emerged, much of our work was shared as fleeting and ephemeral sketches on Twitter or Instagram. We might get some likes and hearts on social media, and then it would be pretty much forgotten as we moved onto the next idea.\nBut Meridian was a really different approach, where I spent months working on a single piece of code, with a strong intent for how I wanted the project to look and come together. Like many other blockchain-based projects, the outputs would be collected, shared, scrutinized, and analyzed for months and in a way that you would never see with a Twitter post. \nEach of the 1,000 editions of Meridian acts as a slice or view into an infinite landscape of different terrains. \n\nMatt DesLauriers, Meridian #146, 2021. Courtesy of the artist\nThe title, Meridian, is itself inspired by Earth\u2019s longitudes, but instead of coordinates in physical space, I imagine the cryptographic hashes associated with each digital token to represent inputs into a multidimensional parametric space. The minimalistic prime style is named after the planet\u2019s prime meridian, which sits at 0\u00ba (Greenwich), and the attributes for this style suggest it could be considered a starting point.\nEven before I released the project, I wanted it to be something that would span both digital and print media. The way the work looks and the way it acts really lends itself to being printed because it is made up of these tiny little strokes which most people will never see when they view it on a screen. With a print, you can get up close and see those details. The Meridian book, published with Vetro Editions, brings together all 1,000 outputs alongside technical essays that dive into my process and thoughts as an artist. The outputs have this really tactile feel in the book that you don\u2019t get on a backlit computer screen. We were surprised by the demand, selling out our stock pretty quickly, so we reissued the book in 2023 as a second edition with a new cover design.\n\nMatt DesLauriers, Meridian (2021) from the second book edition of Meridian, published in 2023 by Vetro Editions\n\u200dAE: Do you draw a distinction between generative art and generative drawing or what was once called \u201cplotter art\u201d? To me, it sometimes feels as though generative art collapses prints, plots, and even paintings into a generalized category of physical.  \n\u200dMDL: I often use the term \u201cgenerative art\u201d as a catch-all in order to embrace everything that is going on in the space. [But] there are generative systems, and then there are very rule-based [algorithms] that, each time you run them, are very predictable to the point where they don\u2019t feel emergent in the way that you would expect of a generative system.\nI find a lot of inspiration in plotters and old-school drawing systems.

When I got my first plotter some years ago, it shifted all of the work that I was doing. Before that, I had been really into shaders, doing pixel-based things and image-based work with strong post-processing effects. The plotter took me back to the basics of a line and a limited color palette. Meridian is basically plotter marks but if the pen were changed with every stroke. Many of its outputs are drawn using only two or three ink colors, as though one were using a set of real pens. I guess my work is a bit more like generative drawing or an algorithmic drawing system or something like that. \n\nMatt DesLauriers, Filigree, 2024. Courtesy of the artist and The Disruptive Gallery\n\u200dAE: In a recent interview, William Mapan noted a trend toward \u201ctextures and natural media in the generative art space.\u201d A certain handmade aesthetic has become quite popular in the last couple of years, which suggests a pervading interest in using code to simulate analog art of the past. At a moment when art produced with machine learning frequently overlaps the market for generative art, is this handmade aesthetic a way of preserving some semblance of the human in an increasingly nonhuman domain?\n\u200dMDL: Yeah, that\u2019s one way to understand it that I would generally agree with. That approach is common practice in computer art, and I don\u2019t see it going away. Even some of the earliest computer artworks were attempts to recreate or simulate paint and analog forms. But my interest in the analog and humanness is maybe different to William\u2019s in that I\u2019m exploring mark-making through the lens of constrained systems like pen plotters and ASCII symbols, whereas I think his focus might be more on simulating the physics of a paint stroke through code and getting into every little detail, which is one of the things that makes his work so impressive. I\u2019m not trying to simulate a pen plotter, but I am taking some of the constraints of analog processes and making them central to my work.\n\u200dAE: A. Michael Noll based one of his earliest works, Ninety-Parallel Sinusoids (1964), on a painting by Bridget Riley, which shows that this kind of emulation has been central to generative practices since the dawn of computer art. What makes Meridian striking to me is the vertical format of the landscapes, which is unusual throughout the history of landscape painting. What prompted that decision? \n\u200dMDL: For the narrow vertical format, I was inspired more by Japanese sumi-e ink drawings than traditional painted landscapes that we see in the West. This is obvious in certain outputs, where I steered the algorithm toward a style of charcoal drawing that looks like an ink wash landscape. Other outputs evoke a colorful prismatic style that feels like a vertical tapestry, reflecting my fascination with Bauhaus designers like Anni Albers. Some of her sketches were on display at Tate Modern in 2019, where you could see the rule-based logic that underscored that period of textile design, especially in the use of jacquard looms based on the same punched card system as early computers.\nI do feel like I have more of an affinity with the fields of design and crafts than with painting and fine arts. A lot of the work that I do, including my recent project Sierra (2024), involves trying to bring analog design processes to the forefront by focusing on screen printing, color imaging, and so forth.\n\nMatt DesLauriers, Sierra, 2024.

Last year, Charlotte Kent and I wrote an essay that sought to reframe the blockchain as a kind of time-space with its own native temporal and spatial properties. I think your work visualizes that. \n\u200dMDL: The way I think about this, and the way it might come across in the Meridian book, is as if the generative code is suspended by invisible threads between thousands of nodes or computers around the world. As long as there are still enough nodes attached to it, that code will continue to be discoverable. But there\u2019s a chance that, over the next few decades, those threads might fray and break and, eventually, nobody will be hosting the code anymore. However, that would only happen if everyone in the network decides to leave or move or change their hosting mechanism. In its current form, [the code] is being maintained or at least archived through this system in a way that none of my other projects really is, which is fascinating to me. Most of the projects that I was releasing online several years ago are either no longer online or you can only see them if you\u2019re logged into Twitter, or else they are just 404 errors. \nWith some of my old works, I\u2019m having to continually pay to host and keep them alive. One day, when I\u2019m gone, those things will probably disappear unless someone else tries to maintain them. But with projects like Meridian or FOLIO or Subscapes (2021) it\u2019s like you\u2019re putting the code into a common system and state of suspension that will be upheld for a very long time. \nIn the book, I have a page that explains the digital archiving of the project. If, let\u2019s say, the Art Blocks website goes away, how do you actually retrieve the image? How do you retrieve the code? The book allows someone in a hypothetical future to see the contract addresses and assemble things back together from the chain without needing to rely on centralized hosting. \n\nMatt DesLauriers, Subscapes #180, 2021. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dAE: I find the language of \u201csuspension\u201d interesting, as though code is a liquid medium or aqueous solution. I\u2019m also happy you mention Subscapes, which is a project that A.V. Marraccini discussed in her study of your and Zancan\u2019s work. She posed the question: \u201cIs Subscapes natural? Is it artificial? Yes. And yes. Matt DesLauriers\u2019s little worlds here prod both the nature-artifice line and that of reproducibility and uniqueness.\u201d Does that line between nature and artifice resonate with you?\n\u200dMDL: Yeah, I think so. Both Subscapes and Meridian are driven by natural systems and geography, as is hachure (2023). I like thinking about the topology of a mountain as well as the structure, rules, and parameters that come together to create forms that are so naturally beautiful.\nWhen you take these sets of rules or mathematical equations, in some ways you\u2019re taking an approximation of the real natural systems that exist around us. \nI like to imagine those surveyors that you might see on the street, with a tripod and camera, taking measurements and constructing a drawing with CAD [computer-aided design]. Subscapes is like that but for a multiverse of infinite worlds. The drawing system it uses is very pen plotter-inspired, so each piece is almost like an artificial survey of a natural thing. But, in reality, it\u2019s not natural, it\u2019s all artificial. So yes and yes, I guess. [Laughs] But I was also thinking about the work like collectibles in a computer game, which is where the isometric viewpoint came from. I grew up with a lot of old-school, real-time strategy games such as SimCity that often used an isometric perspective. \n\u200dAE: Do you see yourself as a generator of worlds? \n\u200dMDL: I like that phrase because I am trying almost to transport the audience into these hypothetical terrains or worlds that don\u2019t necessarily exist in another dimension but rather in the parameter space of the algorithm.

Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dAE: What about a work like FOLIO where you flatten out the motif to the point where you lose the different gradients of suspended space and it becomes something more like a textile.\n\u200dMDL: Yeah, FOLIO feels very textile in the way that it renders line by line, like weaving row by row. It\u2019s also not really trying to capture the parameter space in a spatial sense. That project is more about the system, punching symbols all the way down and then repeating the process with a second and third color, almost like a teletype printer.\nWith FOLIO I was trying to express the ephemerality of generative art. If you don\u2019t save the program \u2014 the code as well as the seed of randomness \u2014 then you basically lose that output. A lot of generative artists struggle with that. \nI sometimes get a client who asks to have something printed that was posted on Instagram many years ago. I have to tell them that I can never generate that image ever again at a higher resolution, even though I still have the source code, because I lost the seed of random entropy. It\u2019s a pretty weird thing for a digital artist to lose their work so easily. Usually the next question is: \u201cbut can\u2019t you just rerun it?\u201d or \u201chow about something else close to it?\u201d Generative systems don\u2019t work like that.\nThe FOLIO experience was trying to accentuate that by making the 100 minters aware that, when they entered commands into the computer terminal, they were permanently suspending the state of the code and its random entropy on the blockchain so that it might be forever retrievable.\n\nMatt DesLauriers, FOLIO #99, 2022. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dAE: Back in the 19th century, there were competing theories about how the Earth\u2019s crust had evolved, which affected how landscape artists depicted different topologies. Some people argued for uniformitarianism, whereby changes in the landscape are the result of continuous and uniform processes. While others argued for catastrophism, by which the physical world is viewed as the result of sudden violent events. Are such notions still relevant to a generator of digital terrain today?\n\u200dMDL: In hachure, I was thinking about rules and parameters that give terrain its unique features. A lot of procedural systems in generative art use noise, for instance Perlin noise. But a real mountain will have flows, gullies, rivulets, and all sorts of other structures and topologies. The system in hachure is a basic one, driven by many tiny particles of water, as if I\u2019m speeding up erosion to see what the landscape would look like a million years later. But the chaos and catastrophe of a natural landscape is really hard to capture in a coded and rule-based system. \nAt one point, I compared my generated height maps to satellite imagery, and I could see the incredible level of complexity of the real mountains, born of so many different processes crashing together. It would take a lifetime to try and code all of those rules.\nA lot of what generative artists are doing is trying to look at chaos in their algorithmic systems and tame it, play with it. That is tricky with a long-form project, where you might try to make each output strong enough on its own but you still need to introduce some surprises between outputs so that the whole collection doesn\u2019t collapse into one. After thousands of outputs you might find a gem where all the parameters line up to create something completely unexpected. In Meridian, that only happened with a couple of outputs. But that chaos is like the chaos present in every aspect of natural terrain, where all the different systems line up and the whole thing is impossible to reconstruct.\n\nMatt DesLauriers, The Sferic Project, 2023-ongoing.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11302, "end_char_idx": 15898, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "417f90bb-59fb-4cd5-ac16-2ca9d6d41965": {"__data__": {"id_": "417f90bb-59fb-4cd5-ac16-2ca9d6d41965", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6da9caad-c649-43a3-8267-c79bc49b850b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "574750e4d55191a7580789b4e509f589e9715648d7ca8280963288ad919c6cc0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c1c030c6-3fed-4aa0-a7e3-37dcd53f2ade", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b22fd432dbd4322c8b4ac452375463eb99ae62dde2db9175f1e3e3860fbf7873", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It would take a lifetime to try and code all of those rules.\nA lot of what generative artists are doing is trying to look at chaos in their algorithmic systems and tame it, play with it.

I think that a lot of what we\u2019re doing is skeuomorphic and is simulation. Obviously, Meridian and Subscapes are landforms and terrains that simulate mountains and things like that. But I\u2019m more interested in simulating the system than simulating an image of the system. I\u2019m not trying to simulate an image or visual of nature; I\u2019m interested in rules and parameters and what happens when you combine them into a single process. \nI find that if I focus too much on trying to construct an image of reality, the process and system behind it is lost and the work becomes only about the visual output. With natural systems, it\u2019s very hard to construct something better than Mother Nature.\n\u200dAE: It sounds like you\u2019re drawing a distinction between naturalism and literalism, between the production of something equivalent to a natural system and the simulation of its literal appearance.

I also think it ties in with some of my ongoing projects, like The Sferic Project, which involves capturing nature and analyzing it.

However, even before Web3 he was already sharing visually striking and politically pointed works of digital art across Flickr, Tumblr, and beyond. His open-source pixel-sorting algorithm has also allowed thousands of digital creators to modify existing images, in the process uniting pixel, generative, and glitch art according to the logic of wilful malfunction.\nIn recent years, projects including Monogrid (2021), Cargo (2023), and COLORS OF NOISE (2023) have continued to beguile collectors through their characteristic brand of Digital Expressionism. While Asendorf\u2019s inclusion as one of the \u201cfirst 15\u201d artists to participate in the MOMA Postcard reflects his stature in the wider art world.

Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dRiver Davis: The life of a digital artist is an often precarious one and you were creating long before the NFT explosion. What can you tell us about your early career? How did you keep moving forward with your art practice even through tough times?\n\u200dKim Asendorf: Being at art school was the best time because you only needed a little bit of money and had the whole day to be creative and do artistic projects. I also worked as a research assistant for a year at the time. After that, my wife Jana and I decided to move to Berlin together with our two-year-old son, which is where the struggle started because, of course, we needed to earn money to pay the rent. By 2017, we were broke and I needed to get a \u201creal\u201d job. At that moment, it felt like: \u201cOK, this is bad because I\u2019m no longer part of the art world,\u201d by which I mean the space of online creativity rather than the traditional art world. \nI ended up going offline and living in a cave for some time, not producing any art for as much as three years. However, I still had to express myself so I mostly focused on making dark techno music using my synthesizers. For a few months, working a nine-to-five job was refreshing because I was able to go home and relax in the knowledge that I was making money and providing for my family. But then, slowly, I got depressed to a point when I ended up getting seriously sick. \nIn our first session, my 87-year-old therapist said to me: \u201cOK, I have 17 diseases, five of which are deadly, so what\u2019s your problem? I\u2019m still doing my job because this is my passion and my life.\u201d He was 100% right. I had to quit my job and return to my art. \nI reached out to a few people close to me, including my old professor from Kassel, Joel Baumann, and the artists Aram Bartholl from Berlin and Hans Bernard from Vienna. Of course, it was a bit embarrassing to say: \u201chey, sorry, I haven\u2019t reached out for three years, but now I\u2019m asking you for help.\u201d But luckily everyone was very supportive and pushed me to make art again. Ultimately, I went back online to see what was going on and there was this \u201cNFT space\u201d that I\u2019d never heard of. By then, I knew about crypto, but the NFT stuff was super interesting and a new source of inspiration. \n\nKim Asendorf, Mountain Tour \u2014 Aaefhinnorrrst A, 2010.

At a certain point, it struck me that I needed to make a website made up of grids. Then I started experimenting and coding, and it grew into a mixture of experimental and conceptual work, back and forth between the two. Monogrid was the first work that I knew should grow as part of the blockchain community.\n\nKim Asendorf, Monogrid (random output), 2021. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dRD: In a digital art world where authenticity, ownership, provenance, and storage define the value of art, your body of work straddles the impermanence of Web2 and the supposed permanence of Web3. Outside of a few pieces that one can interact with using the Wayback Machine, much of your old work is lost to the ephemera of the internet and the updates of its native operating systems and GUI interfaces. This is (I assume) a result of the technical debt required to maintain each project from update to update in perpetuity. Has this influenced the way you use and value blockchain technology?\n\u200dKA: When the Web2 platforms emerged, websites from Facebook to Flickr offered APIs (access points) into their services, which was a super nice tool. I could upload an image to Flickr to show it or create an artwork that utilized the whole platform. One of my favorite pieces from that time was titled How Many Images Am I Able to Upload Until Flickr Locks My Account? (2011). It comprised a bot that generated meaningless images of numbers with a little background color and uploaded them to Flickr automatically. I announced it as a performance, and a few people followed it and reloaded my Flickr profile to follow its progress. I think there were about 20,000 uploads before Flickr locked the account. I also used the Google Maps API for a few projects, but Google made so many updates. \nI wasn\u2019t very interested in keeping those works alive \u2014 some art is only right for today, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep it alive online for years if it is a fragment of the past. Those works were intended as comments on the moment.\n\nKim Asendorf, How Many Images Am I Able to Upload Until Flickr Locks My Account?, 2011. Courtesy of the artist\nPrior to Web3, I was also playing with RSS feeds. I developed a project called Censored Censored Chinese News (2010) following the many discussions in the media that the news in China was pretty strict. We encountered more or less institutionalized censorship, so I got all the RSS feeds from Chinese news sites and censored parts of them at random. My website, \u201cCensored Censored Chinese News,\u201d streamed the news with black bars over random text fragments. I can\u2019t read Chinese, so it was 100% conceptual.

In 2013, there was a protest against suppression in Taksim Gezi Park in Istanbul, where the Turkish police were acting pretty harshly with tear gas and water cannons. \nFor me, it felt like the first time that participants in a protest were uploading huge volumes of images to the web. Thousands of violent pictures surfaced, and I felt a need to respond to that. \nOle Fach and I started a Tumblr account called Gezi gelen Limon, meaning \u201clemons from Gezi\u201d or \u201cyou need lemons to neutralize your burning eyes.\u201d We took all these violent images, put them in Photoshop, and used the smart eraser tool to remove the violence. If we saw a policeman with a stick then we removed the stick, and so forth. We then uploaded the same pictures shot earlier that day back to the same internet at the same time, thereby creating a new stream of images based on real events while they were still ongoing. At the time, that work felt very on point and it was later included as part of the \u201cglobal aCtIVISm\u201d exhibition at ZKM Center for Art and Media. But I wouldn\u2019t choose that topic anymore as it has too many depressing associations. \n\nKim Asendorf and Ole Fach, Gezi gelen Limon, 2013. Courtesy of the artists\n\u200dRD: I was able to trace the origin of the term \u201cDigital Expressionism\u201d to a 2013 paper, which emphasized the role of digital design in allowing innovative forms and complex geometries that were less feasible in the past. While Reed Hearne has since defined it as \u201ca blending of the subjective, emotional impact of Expressionism with the Abstract Expressionist notion that the creative process is as much the art as the evidence of it left behind.\u201d How do you define Digital Expressionism in the context of your artistic practice? \n\u200dKA: For me personally, labels are not important. I\u2019ve done works that can be considered glitch art, generative art, net art, and otherwise. \nIt\u2019s not important for me to label myself with something that is already established. I would not call myself a media artist nor a generative artist because I don\u2019t fit into one single group. It has always been important for me to create my own expressions. \n\u201cDigital\u201d is the word that best describes my work because digital technologies enable me to do so many uniquely interesting and creative things. Expressionism is also hard for me to contextualize. Ultimately, my work is a form of communication. I\u2019m not a writer; I\u2019m not telling a story in front of a bunch of people \u2014 that\u2019s not my medium. My medium is art, which I use to express what\u2019s on my mind in a very personal way. What I do has no general meaning or value, but it means everything to me. What I put out now comes from my deepest inner self \u2014 that\u2019s the expressionist component. But I also find it interesting that, as a visual style, expressionism can involve something less explicit, something that offers room for interpretation \u2014 an abstraction. \n\nKim Asendorf, Event Horizon #91, 2023.

The algorithm is another component \u2014 maybe the most interesting and playful \u2014 and now, with blockchain, you can also integrate smart-contract functionality. \nThe worlds that I create need a certain level of complexity to feel interesting to me. The macro-micro relationship is more a question of style.\nGenerative art, for me, is a simple concept that I incorporate without dwelling on it too much. You might create an algorithm, but it\u2019s sometimes unclear what that algorithm does itself because you are always adding random features or values to restart the algorithm and produce a different output. What is important is that these variations pile up on top of each other. The generative component is that one decision builds upon another, which can go in a completely different direction than another version of the same code. It\u2019s interesting to play with that. But I have no clue what is good or what is bad. For me, that is personal preference.\nI think it\u2019s important that I write good, clean code. I\u2019m certainly not the best coder, mathematician, or anything like that. But, over the years, I\u2019ve learned that I need to create a setup where I can work at speed. I see the code as the craft; that\u2019s where you need to be good. But it\u2019s also impossible to say what is more important, the code or the output, because both are important. If we are talking about art then it matters what the work does for the people who look at it or interact with it. But it\u2019s also hard to say what the artwork is. I recall a disagreement between Casey Reas and Zach Lieberman where Zach said that the code doesn\u2019t matter as much as the output he is going to be looking at, while Casey regarded the code as the real artwork, with the output just an offshoot. For me, it\u2019s impossible to decide but, ultimately, what people feel is the most important thing for me. \n\nKim Asendorf, Cargo #686, 2023. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dRD: What would you tell new digital artists to help them on their career path? \n\u200dKA: That\u2019s a good question. There are many paths out there that one can take, and there\u2019s an art to finding your own path from all the possibilities. One approach might be to release anything and everything, because that creates a dialogue with your audience. That would probably be frustrating and even disappointing but it would certainly be educational. I support the view that it takes seven years to become an expert, and it takes time to develop as an artist. On the other hand, it\u2019s probably not smart to mint all your work at the beginning with the idea of making money from it. That might work for a genius or for someone who hits the bullseye at a particular moment, but that\u2019s exceptional. \nIf I were at art school now, I would adopt a more moderate approach. I would produce unrelated works that don\u2019t need to be minted, have fun, find my tools, and do exhibitions here and there. You learn the most from putting your artwork in a room and seeing how people react. Do they even see it or do they walk past it? Likewise, It might be annoying to have minted something ten years ago that you are now embarrassed by. Another approach is to be very careful about every step. You can certainly become an expert on your own without communicating with anyone else, optimizing your craft independently without releasing any mediocre works, all the while learning from the exhibitions of others. But a decent or successful career does require a strategy. \nI\u2019m not an organized person. I live by chaos theory. \nI think that following known paths is never the right way for an artist. But then, no recipe fits perfectly for everyone.

With every show built on a distinct curatorial vision, taken together they help to tell the story of digital art in the 21st century. Two participants in the Retrospective, Tyler Hobbs and 0xDEAFBEEF, have become prominent figures in the movement for generative art. Despite their different approaches, both are preoccupied with code as a raw material and building block of the world. In this special conversation, they discuss the close relationship between generative art and physical craft with Elisabeth Sweet and Alex Estorick.\u200d\u200d\n\n0xDEAFBEEF, Sketches in Iron, 2022. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dElisabeth Sweet: Could you both say a bit about yourselves and tell us about your Feral File projects, F(l)ight (2021) and Sketches in Iron (2022)? \n\n\u200dTyler Hobbs: I\u2019m a generative artist and, since 2014, I have built my practice primarily around code. I will typically construct an algorithm that generates static, 2D, abstract visual imagery. But I\u2019ve always spent a lot of time drawing by hand as well. One channel of my work has been looking at ways to integrate the hand and the algorithm. F(l)ight came out of a particular approach to capturing drawings by hand as vector data that can be manipulated by the algorithm \u2014 looking for ways to modify and expand on what the hand is able to do.\n\nThere\u2019s something special to me about birds in flight as a subject, so I did a lot of preparatory drawings and ended up selecting five different kinds of birds, and then manipulated them algorithmically to produce a final set of 30 works, all of which were then executed as pen-plotter drawings on paper. All the works in the \u201c-GRAPH\u201d show were centered around the plotter, which is a simple two-axis robot that you can put a pin in and give instructions to draw something. It\u2019s a great way to translate a digital idea into the physical world. F(l)ight was also concerned with the actual physical production of these works, and so a lot of the quality and character of that work is driven by the need to execute it physically. \n\nI like how the physical element showed up in both the genesis and the final execution of the work \u2014 it started with the hand, went through this digital algorithmic phase, and ended up back on paper at the end of the work.\n\nA plotter drawing F(l)ight (2021) by Tyler Hobbs. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200d0xDEAFBEEF: For the past 20 years, I\u2019ve been immersed in a wide assortment of fields that overlap art and tech. I\u2019ve studied music and electrical engineering; I\u2019ve run a music recording studio; I\u2019ve done some research and computer graphics; and, until recently, I supported myself as a blacksmith running an artisan craft business making hand-forged jewelry out of alternative metals. I like to explore and tinker, usually in a self-directed solitary way.\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m best known in this space as an audiovisual generative artist. In recent years, I\u2019ve adopted an art practice that intentionally used a minimal toolset. I purposely chose a cheap laptop and a C compiler, and then tried to write code from scratch that can produce sound and animation without using any type of external library. Now I attempt to make code-based work that incorporates generative sound and music, while exploring some of the unique affordances of programmable blockchains. \n\nI don\u2019t have as much time as I\u2019d like for blacksmithing but I look for ways to incorporate it into my art practice. I really enjoy working with my hands and with real materials, making my own tools and machines, which I think overlaps with generative code. \nMy Feral File project, Sketches in Iron (2022), is about the interconnection of many systems.

I\u2019m Type 1 diabetic, so I use the number of my blood sugar reading as a random seed for a generative software system that I run on the spot in real time to make a visual design.

The point of it is to question the idea of any of these things as distinct categories and polar opposites, instead seeing the whole thing as a continuum. The pioneering media artist and writer, Roy Ascott, has written at length about the art-making process as a cybernetic system in which the artist is only one subsystem in a complicated feedback loop with your environment. I wanted to show that and expose the varying degrees of agency and autonomy of all these components. \n\n\n0xDEAFBEEF, Hashmarks, 2023 (coming soon). Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dAlex Estorick: It sounds like we\u2019re not talking about humans and machines so much as the relationship between craft and the tradition of fine art. Tyler, what do you see as the implications of generative systems beyond digital art?\u200d\n\nTH: What constitutes a generative system is much broader than many people may think. It doesn\u2019t even need to involve code. It\u2019s really about the artists adopting a mindset and a practice that removes themselves from complete control over the final outcome. The artist is really thinking about how to construct a system with interesting possibilities that might surprise even the artist in terms of their outcome. \n\nThat\u2019s really the trade-off \u2014 the artist loses control, but they gain this ability for the system to really surprise them. \nCode is an excellent way of doing that, and it has a lot of advantages \u2014 you can build an incredibly complex and specific type of system. But there are physical processes and other approaches to art-making that achieve those same artistic goals without the use of code at all. I think the natural world provides a wonderful source of chaos and randomness. Even photography depends on the subject. With a bird in flight, the photographer doesn\u2019t have complete control over exactly what\u2019s going to come out. I view the generative methodology as a spectrum and a broad range of approaches to making work. \n\n\u200d0xD: I resonate with a lot of that. People have been arguing about the definition of generative art for a long time. \n\n[Generative art] is a pretty broad term. And if you take it for what it is, you can make the argument that all of our making processes are generative. \nIf you\u2019re an abstract painter, what you ate for breakfast could potentially influence how you\u2019re feeling when you start to put paint on the canvas. One has to be a little bit more specific about definitions, but I certainly agree that one definitely doesn't have to use code or computers to have generative systems; there are lots of examples stretching back throughout history.

Courtesy of the artist and Pace Gallery\n\u200dAE: What strikes me is the sheer range of references that you are both making, which leads me to wonder whether one can possibly differentiate good generative art from bad\u2026 \n\n\u200dTH: [...] I think it has a lot to do with thinking about the space that the artist has constructed. I often get the question: \u201cwhat is the work of art with a generative work? Is it the specific outputs or is it the code? Or is it the idea of the algorithm?\u201d \n\nAs the artist, what I like to think of as the work is really the potential space of the algorithm, and the potential set of outputs that can come from that algorithm. \nHopefully, you\u2019re presenting in a way that really does effectively display that space, which is where curation becomes an important aspect of the project. It\u2019s just about choosing how you display the space. Whether you take a really trivial algorithm or one with a really specific vision \u2014 where randomness doesn\u2019t play a huge structural role \u2014 overall, the output of that algorithm is going to be very predictable. And so you can take any output and it\u2019ll do a relatively good job of showing the space. Maybe you only need one or two images to capture that space.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re working on an Art Blocks project, and every single output is going to be immortalized as part of the final collection. As an artist, you have to think about a very different kind of space to craft. The potential output space needs to be very strong. If you\u2019re going to capture 500 of these [outputs] without curation, then you need to make sure that the type of variety that the algorithm expresses is interesting for 500 non-curated outputs.\n\nA project like QQL (2022), which involves a curation step, allows you to craft a very different kind of space because you no longer need to worry so much about every single output. You can maybe ignore 99.99% of the outputs and really think about the far-reaching corners of that space \u2014 those are what are really going to be highlighted. Curation is a really important axis for the design of a generative project because it has really big implications for how you as the artist shape that generative output space. And it would be a major mistake not to take that into account when thinking about designing the space. \n\n\n0xDEAFBEEF, Glitchbox 187, 2021. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dAE: DEAFBEEF, when I hear a phrase like \u201coutput space,\u201d it makes me think not only about the way space might impact a viewer in a visual sense, but also the political and social implications of a space that you might have created. How do you view your creative potential to shape the digital spaces that we are now inhabiting?\n\n\u200d0xD: In preparing for this, I tried to think about the social and political implications of generative art. We can have these formalist ideas about how we measure a generative art piece, but generative art is a form, not necessarily the content. Generative art can be about something overtly political or else it can be about itself \u2014 sometimes the form and the content overlap and sometimes not at all. \n\nIn the 1960s, using code or computers to make art had radical political implications. Chuck Csuri made an overtly political work, Random War (1967). While Max Bense\u2019s motivation for developing his theory of rational generative aesthetics was that rationality was the primary defense against fascism in post-war Germany, which was deeply influential to those pioneering generative artists. \n\nTo be honest, my whole motivation for working with code to make abstract animation and sound was purely for my own amusement. I love formalist work and I love abstract works. I feel like, today, using code doesn\u2019t necessarily carry the same connotations that it used to. A work isn\u2019t automatically meaningful just because it uses code. This is something we have to struggle with as there\u2019s a push for generative art to be recognized within the larger canon, or else by the contemporary art world, where it\u2019s been ignored. \n\nI think there\u2019s a legitimate criticism that sometimes generative art can struggle to express anything beyond its own formalism, unless there\u2019s actually a pure intention to make it overly about something else. \nThat\u2019s not a value judgment \u2014 I like both. But it might be an issue for certain discourses. I don\u2019t have an art background and I wasn\u2019t part of the \u201cart world\u201d anytime before, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7653, "end_char_idx": 12120, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83c8427f-b8bd-47c9-be71-e680fc6495bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "83c8427f-b8bd-47c9-be71-e680fc6495bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b6ef5ef1-b438-4029-8226-6ed38443e00a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c98c82e49bd607cf20ddec9cc9e6e6bb6d6b5ffb865a871d6377175a9fabb00c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8074db55-8575-48ad-b55a-08fe45a3c02c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "daf38b497ab5781d586d67f1947bf793bed96a7f3a7198ad5dce3b771f498a78", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8b649975-8e94-48f9-b02b-1961f6ff820a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9fd4e5ed2f4e453c1ae7e4a75bb35986d50de24a3e8d2697496d38411f86e68d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u200dAE: The history of modernist painting, in many ways, is a history of artists producing objects to be looked at by a detached spectator. And while a lot of generative art produced right now is very visually seductive, a work like QQL as well as a project like fx(params) rely on co-creation and depend on completion by their audience. Does the generative artist depend on co-creation with their collectors? \n\n\u200dTH: I really feel that the more generative a work is, the more curation plays an important role. Generally speaking, when we start to look at these systems \u2014 algorithmic works and AI art \u2014 where it\u2019s relatively inexpensive to look at a huge swathe of an output space, that\u2019s where the discerning eye, curation, and thoughtful selection become really important. \n\nI feel that the power is shifting a little bit from the creator to the curator. \nAs the artist, you can choose not to make yourself the curator by appointing another artist, your collectors, the community, or an AI to curate the output. You have a lot of power in that way [and] that aspect of the work is increasingly important for a lot of generative works these days. However, for example, Fidenza (2021) had no curation and I think it was a successful project. So by no means is [curation] necessary but more frequently it\u2019s an important component of the work.\n\n\u200d0xD: Part of the reason why we\u2019ve seen this explosion is because we\u2019re using the blockchain as a proxy for these types of social interactions, as a collective experience. It used to be a bit more ephemeral and if you shared things on the internet or on social media it was there and then it was gone. Having the blockchain as a game board or a point of reference is something new. That experience has really been important for generative art. When you start adding these different token mechanisms, and different programmable elements to the work, that\u2019s really getting into interesting territory, and QQL was a great example of that.\n\n\nTyler Hobbs and Dandelion Wist, parametric artist 0xDEAFBEEF, QQL #39, 2022. Courtesy of the artists\n\u200dES: Thinking about generative programs and how the number of outputs are into the thousands, and then thinking about tokenomics and market incentives, is there an argument for creating a generative program that only produces one artwork? Or does that go against what the program was made for?\n\n\u200dTH: That question drives at the difference between algorithmic and generative work. If you look at their Venn diagram, it\u2019s a messy picture and neither has a perfectly clear definition. You could write an algorithm that generates exactly one image every single time that it\u2019s run, and many algorithmic artists have done this over the years. I did this myself, especially when I was getting started, which was an easier target for me to work towards. \n\nTo me, a really interesting shift takes place when you start to design the algorithm with multiple outputs in mind, from thinking about a single visual output versus that entire system of possibilities and that output space. Having worked as a traditional artist in the past, shifting to that mindset was the biggest change in switching to generative art \u2014 it was bigger than going from figurative to abstract and bigger than the switch from working with my hands to working with code. \n\nThinking in terms of an entire potential output space was the biggest fundamental shift and the one that seemed the most compelling out of all the reasons to make generative work. \nYou can write an algorithm that makes one particular output, you can do that to make something that looks amazing.

There are some people who believe that prizing the individual outputs of a generative algorithm might even amount to a fetish. \n\n\u200dAE: We recently released an interview with Michael Noll, who published a technical memorandum back in 1962 documenting his work at Bell Labs.

My background is not formally in art but in electrical engineering, sound technology, music, and computer animation. A lot of my influence has stemmed from that. If you\u2019re a practicing artist who is trying to say something within a particular discourse, that\u2019s going to influence what you do. With me, I\u2019ve just been tinkering in my basement and garage.

Courtesy of the artist\nWhen I was studying computer animation in grad school, I learned a lot about the history of technology including people from the commercial animation and commercial film industries. John Whitney pioneered a lot of generative work as did Lillian Schwartz. Larry Cuba worked on Star Wars. \n\nI have colleagues who have won Academy Awards for algorithms that they have made for special effects or character animation or lighting. That\u2019s not really ever talked about in a fine art discourse, but that\u2019s sort of my lineage.\nThe other thing is games. My earliest introduction to procedural systems was playing roguelikes when I was a kid. The graphics were really simple \u2014 ASCII terminal type of stuff with characters representing a 2D map. But every time you played, the level had a different structure to it; it had randomization. That\u2019s what really influenced my desire to explore computing. I spent my childhood learning how to do that basically in an effort to write games. \n\nLater, I became interested in electronic music and synthesizers, as well as animation. There are so many pioneering people \u2014 Oskar Fischinger and Norman McLaren, for example \u2014 who did stuff with sound and music that is generative that happened before the visual stuff, simply because it was easier to work with a one-dimensional signal than it was to work with, say, a raster display or plotter.

DEAFBEEF, I do find it fascinating that you\u2019re a metalworker, and it feels like the notion of versatile generative creators trying to fit themselves into pre-existing lineages is a problem for the ages. Tyler, does a fine art audience receive your work differently to a Web3 audience? \n\n\u200dTH: Of course, anytime that I\u2019m making a work I\u2019m likely to be thinking about the context in which it will be seen. If I\u2019m making work for Pace Gallery, then I\u2019m going to be making a different kind of work than I would for Art Blocks. But, fundamentally, it has to be interesting to me. \n\nThere is something really important about storytelling. As the artist, you usually have some opportunity to talk about the work \u2014 from how you title the show to how you title the works. You have an artist statement and you do things like Twitter Spaces and other promotions. I think you have to be cognizant that people in different spheres speak different languages and have different reference points. With a traditional art space, I might be able to lean into talking about elements of the generative methodology that I see in the work of Richard Diebenkorn, who is a traditional abstract painter and very well-known in the traditional art world. But maybe only a small percentage of people are going to recognize his name on a Twitter Space. People want to understand the work that they\u2019re looking at, and how you talk about a work helps them to draw from these reference points. That\u2019s part of the value of talking about your work as an artist. \n\nI come from a programming background, so I\u2019m able to talk about my work from a more technical perspective. But, of course, I\u2019ve also spent a lot of time studying fine art. Overall, the kind of work I make doesn\u2019t change, but maybe how I talk about it does.\n\n0xDEAFBEEF, Caves, 2022.

I\u2019m wondering if you have any thoughts about how that\u2019s influenced your particular aesthetic, and how constraints can breed creativity. \n\n\u200d0xD: When I started working this way, I was already familiar with C, working in a terminal with command line tools and without using a mouse. I enjoyed it but I didn\u2019t know what was going to come out. It was like playing a roguelike game. That comes through in the pseudonym that I chose for myself \u2014 DEAFBEEF is an example of Hexspeak.\n\nI know that if I use Ableton Live, there\u2019s a prescribed workflow for design tools that will lead you down a path, and if you\u2019re going to do something different, you have to work against it. But without any of that structure, I didn\u2019t know exactly what would come out. It\u2019s like beginning a sentence without knowing how you\u2019re going to finish it. Curiosity was the driving force [and] the exploration is what makes it motivating and fun. I don\u2019t know if working that way will necessarily produce any better results. But it would produce something more unique to the way that you work, which will be more meaningful to you.

Courtesy of the artist\nProgramming language design also has a big influence. I\u2019m certain that the API that Casey Reas and Ben Fry came up with for Processing has had a tremendous cascading effect on thousands of artworks ever since. I chose a programming language that\u2019s kind of esoteric but really powerful if you\u2019re a solo coder. It\u2019s a programming language called Clojure, which is a Lisp dialect that gives you a lot of flexibility and power to do complicated things very succinctly. But it\u2019s not great for collaboration because it\u2019s so customizable that you can do your own weird and idiosyncratic things. \n\nOf course, it\u2019s not only the programming language but also the code you\u2019ve written before that really shapes what you do next. A big part of my tooling at this point is all these little chunks of algorithms that I\u2019ve already built. I have tons of code sitting around that does all kinds of interesting things with flow fields that I can just copy and paste and get to work really quickly. I\u2019m much more likely to reach into my bag and grab some flow field code to generate curves. That\u2019s been true of artists throughout time \u2014 painters tend to develop a visual language that they rely on rather than reinventing the wheel every time they start a new painting. They tend to use similar colors, textures, and compositional strategies. But with algorithmic artwork, it gets even more amplified because it\u2019s much easier to reuse and extend the ideas that you\u2019ve built before. \n\n\u200d0xD: That\u2019s fascinating. Someone once told me that, with blacksmithing, if you want to know the quality of someone\u2019s work you look at their tools (because blacksmiths make their own tools).

With this in mind, it was no surprise that the Generative Artists Club voted Piter Pasma into Feral File\u2019s new exhibition, \u201cN=12,\u201d which celebrates collaboration as a critical component of generative art. Pasma is a pillar of the community \u2014 an artist whose mastery derives from his rare ability to manipulate pixels via complex mathematical equations, expressed in elegant, economical code.\nFar from embracing the enigma, however, Pasma eagerly shares his secrets with other artists and appreciators alike. He is generous with his time, feedback, and tools, and his pseudorandom number generator makes multiple appearances in \u201cN=12.\u201d Yet despite his importance, Piter\u2019s influence is often invisible, inspiring a generation toward technical excellence and emergent potential.\n\u2014 Aaron Penne\n\u200d\n\n\n\u200dAlex Estorick: At RCS, we spend a lot of time trying to understand how generative artists working today relate to their historical predecessors. We often cover artists who have emerged in the aftermath of the NFT as well as pioneering figures from the 1960s and \u201970s. However, I\u2019m also mindful of the many digital creators working in the interim period, who often go under the radar. Piter, you emerged from the demoscene of the late 1990s. What made that such a fertile basis for your later practice as a generative artist working on the blockchain? How does the current scene compare with those early experiences?\n\u200dPiter Pasma: The demoscene allowed me to put into practice all the mathematics I was learning through my study of computational science. There was a lot of knowledge sharing, with people writing tutorials and helping each other out. At the same time, it was a rather competitive scene, with demo competitions where individuals would try to one up each other. Today, the size-coding component of the demoscene has proved especially useful for projects like Skulptuur (2021), whose code is written onto the blockchain, which means that every character costs money. \nThe biggest difference between the demoscene and today\u2019s generative art scene is not needing a piece to be real-time animated at 60 frames per second. This has been a breath of fresh air and allows me to explore more complex art. There is also much less competitiveness in the generative art scene. This is neither a bad nor a good thing, simply a noticeable difference. \nThere is no real equivalent to a demoparty in the generative scene, since artist meetups are relatively small-scale. \n\nPiter Pasma, Balls to the Walls (test output), 2023.

One of these was Aaron Penne, now a good friend, who founded the genartclub and invited me to join. The community has been an amazing source of friendship, commercial and technical help, and mental health, while also allowing me to share works in progress.

I will often use ray-tracing and ray-marching of SDFs [signed distance functions], which are mathematical formulas that define 3D scenes. \nBalls to the Walls is a shader-based ray-marching algorithm, involving a particularly colorful rendering technique that came to me during Genuary 2023. \nTo generate interesting scenes, I developed a sphere-packing algorithm, a randomized room, and a clever search algorithm to find interesting light and camera angles.\n\nPiter Pasma, Balls to the Walls (test output), 2023.

Courtesy of the artist and Feral File\n\u200dAE: Your different projects on Art Blocks, fxhash, and Verse reveal the full potential of generative systems beyond the purely pictorial, sculptural, and architectonic. What are the implications of such expansive systems for increasingly digital societies?\n\u200dPP: One other thing I brought with me from the demoscene was a desire to show what computers are really capable of. As the influence of Moore\u2019s Law diminishes, perhaps we\u2019ll find out how much there is to gain if we actually optimize our systems. This may sound strange \u2014 since a lot of my code is written in JavaScript \u2014 but there\u2019s more to performance than a language, and there\u2019s more to capability than performance.\n\u200dAE: Your recent project, Universal Rayhatcher, used fx(params) to involve collectors in the production of new outputs of the algorithm. How do you see the relationship between generative artists and their collectors developing in the future? Will co-creation become fundamental to generative art, or do you regard parametric art as a world apart? \n\u200dPP: I regard \u201cparametric art\u201d as a rather confusing term that already has a lot of associations with generative art and architecture. I think it\u2019s all part of one larger whole. Some of my projects are \u201clong-form\u201d series, comprising many uniquely random outputs, but I\u2019ve also produced a lot of unique single-edition outputs as well, especially with my rayhatcher framework. These involve the careful crafting of mathematical SDF formulas using little to no randomness. Universal Rayhatcher basically allowed other artists \u2014 assuming their SDF skills, mostly vetted by me \u2014 to have the same experience. A number of mind-blowing pieces emerged from this project.\n\nPiter Pasma, Balls to the Walls (test output), 2023. Exhibited in \u201cN=12,\u201d an exhibition curated by Aaron Penne on Feral File.

I changed the \u201ck\u201d in kubi to a \u201cq,\u201d partly because it looks like a neck, and also because of the inverted symmetry of \u201cq\u201d and \u201cb,\u201d which felt symbolic. \u201cqubibi\u201d is a space between two different parts of the body. \nMy art exists in an in-between state. \nWhen I was an interactive web designer, I never knew how a user might interact with my designs.

Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dTT: What motivated your switch from working as an interactive web designer to being an artist?\n\u200dq: It wasn\u2019t my original intention to be an artist, nor was it a deliberate decision to become a designer. I\u2019ve always loved video games but it doesn\u2019t mean I want to create them myself. I still have a ton of old games in my drawers. The first game I ever bought was Spelunker (1983), which is famously difficult. I was also obsessed at one point by Wizardry, a series of games that started in 1981. For some reason, I\u2019ve always been drawn to video games with unreasonable difficulty settings. Certainly, my work as a web designer and my love of video games have influenced my work. \nI\u2019ve always been preoccupied by the solitary relation of a gamer to the screen. This led me to create immersive realms that exist apart from everything else in the world. \nI tend to divide artworks into two \u2014 those that radiate outwards and those that absorb viewers inwards. My output falls into the latter category.\n\nqubibi, (Still from) Drifter, 2013. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dTT: I\u2019ve always felt that sense of being drawn in by your work. What can you tell us about your recent release, \u201cMagical\u201d Door (2022), a work of interactive generative art?\n\u200dq: It\u2019s really just a door opening and closing. That\u2019s all there is to it. A lot of my artworks are inspired by trivial things around me rather than striving for something of deeper significance. I draw deep satisfaction from exerting effort into something so mundane. But that also applies to the audience, whose compulsive interactions with the work remind me of the repetitive reflexes of a child.\nI keep a notepad of keywords, which point to different elements. Words often inspire my new work, and \u201cdoor\u201d is one word that started a creative journey. A door opens and closes multiple times a day, each time making a sound, which then becomes part of the rhythm of life. But a door is also a border demarcating inside from outside that, when opened, externalizes that interior. My work often plays with such notions.\n\u200d\n\nqubibi, \u201cMagical\u201d Door, 2022. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dTT: What is your approach to making generative art? \n\u200dq: While generative art is created with code, for me, it is not based on intention.

It was only later that I realized I was looking at Turing patterns based on natural morphogenesis. \nMy first generative artwork, hello world (2010/2017), sought to imagine how the world takes shape.

Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dTT: Sound also feels like an important component of your work. \n\u200dq: Definitely. For a lot of my work, including mimizu, the workflow begins with a sound. I\u2019m also quite deliberate with the sounds and rhythms that I expose myself to during the creation process. \nWhile my work is not simply audio visualization, without music there would be no artwork. I feel that music is critical to any broader definition of \u201cart.\u201d\n\nqubibi, leftover: 221230d19vCn30003000, 2022. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dTT: Can you tell us about your leftovers, which have become so highly prized in themselves?\n\u200dq: My work on mimizu produced a large number of scraps \u2014 perhaps the leftovers chewed out by the earthworm \u2014 that looked cool but ultimately didn\u2019t make it into the final project. I wanted to take care of those leftovers. The mimizu release involved a lot of pressure, and I wanted a project that was relaxing and satisfying, like eating the last morsel on a plate.\nA leftover is like a relic, and my leftovers are the last remaining relics of my work. The process by which they are created feels like many centuries of mineral formation. Over time, even scraps can become gems, as long as they survive.\n\nqubibi, mimizu: MMZ 217, 2022. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dTT: Are there any major events or influences that have shaped your creative process?\n\u200dq: My life is an ongoing string of beads and, on reflection, it has a certain order. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint events of special importance, but one major influence is Du\u0161an Makavejev\u2019s work of avant-garde surrealism, Sweet Movie (1974). The film is riven by the contrast between the sublime and the grotesque. I didn\u2019t grasp the film\u2019s significance fully the first time I saw it, but I felt compelled to come back to it multiple times in order to fuse the two in my work.\n\nqubibi, storeroom: 220306r03fLj, 2022. Courtesy of the artist\n\u200dTT: How did NFTs capture your attention?\n\u200dq: At first, I was unsettled by NFTs because every post looked like an advertisement.\nBut one night, sitting around a bonfire with a few friends, the great Japanese designer Yugo Nakamura said to me, \u201cYou\u2019re unique in what you\u2019re doing, why don\u2019t you give NFTs a try?\u201d At that moment, I said \u201cno,\u201d but when I woke up the next morning, I minted my first NFT on Hic et Nunc. That was the beginning.\nI don\u2019t have much interest in the technical mechanics of NFTs. But I am excited by the impact they can have on digital art and its future. NFTs have given a platform to so many digital artists, especially generative artists, so I think they are a good thing.\n\nqubibi, storeroom: dl19S1jq323Ps, 2023.
